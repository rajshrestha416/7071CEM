       "  'abstract': 'In aluminum reduction cells, the electric current density at the cathode is seldom uniform. This may be due to a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is that a mass of undissolved alumina may get enrobed by the cryolitic bath, and this mix freezes due to the decrease in temperature below the liquidus point. Thus, an electrically resistive solid layer (“mud”) is formed at a part of the cathode. This leads to horizontal electric currents in the liquid aluminum layer, and their magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interaction with the vertical magnetic field induces a rotating flow of aluminum. This may cause undesirable MHD instabilities. A quasi-two-dimensional model for the laboratory facility has been presented. The results show that the dominating feature of the flow is a depression of the free surface of the liquid metal above the mud spot. This is due to strong rotation of the liquid metal around the mud spot, which causes the centrifugal force. Other effects may include superimposed conventional MHD instability, which manifests itself in a rotating interface, modulated waves, reflection of the waves from the corners of the domain, sloshing, etc. It has been shown that small mud spots do not affect the cell stability, while the large ones may cause such deep depressions that the centrifugal force completely removes the liquid metal above the spot.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Apraxia and action disorganization syndrome (AADS) after stroke can disrupt activities of daily living (ADL). Occupational therapy has been effective in improving ADL performance, however, inclusion of multiple tasks means it is unclear which therapy elements contribute to improvement. We evaluated the efficacy of a task model approach to ADL rehabilitation, comparing training in making a cup of tea with a stepping training control condition.\\nMETHODS: Of the 29 stroke survivors with AADS who participated in this cross-over randomized controlled feasibility trial, 25 were included in analysis [44% females; mean(SD) age = 71.1(7.8) years; years post-stroke = 4.6(3.3)]. Participants attended five 1-hour weekly tea making training sessions in which progress was monitored and feedback given using a computer-based system which implemented a Markov Decision Process (MDP) task model. In a control condition, participants received five 1-hour weekly stepping sessions.\\nRESULTS: Compared to stepping training, tea making training reduced errors across 4 different tea types. The time taken to make a cup of tea was reduced so the improvement in accuracy was not due to a speed-accuracy trade-off. No improvement linked to tea making training was evident in a complex tea preparation task (making two different cups of tea simultaneously), indicating a lack of generalisation in the training.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The clearly specified but flexible training protocol, together with information on the distribution of errors, provide pointers for further refinement of task model approaches to ADL rehabilitation. It is recommended that the approach be tested under errorless learning conditions with more impaired patients in future research.\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 5th August 2019 [NCT04044911] https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04044911?term=Cogwatch&rank=1.',\n",

This is possible by assessing the impact of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) in mitigating disease exposure. This study aims to assess the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 exposure in closed environments. This is achieved by proposing an innovative COVID-19 exposure prediction framework. The developed framework consists of three modules: Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) approach, Clustering Module (CM), and Decision Tree (DT) technique. The framework also integrates these modules considering the exposure time factor to identify the level of exposure to COVID-19 in closed environments. A supermarket based in Jordan is considered a case study to test the applicability of the proposed framework in predicting exposure levels and numbers. The impact of Individual and combined NPIs application in closed environment facilities is assessed based on the exposure level and other OIs such as opening time, body temperature measurement, and the number of people inside the supermarket. Key results show that wearing Mask, Face Shield and leaving Social Distance guarantees no exposure to COVID-19 and increases the safety level to 61.9% in a closed environment such as supermarkets with a potential exposure rate of up to 28.5% if otherwise.',\n",

It is not clear whether EE presents to an equal degree among adults, regardless of their body mass index (BMI) status. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a difference in degree of EE between adults with healthy weight, overweight and obesity. Methods: MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO databases were searched from inception up to January 2022 for studies that reported EE scores from validated questionnaires. The quality of all included studies was assessed using the AXIS tool. Meta‐analysis used random effects and standardised mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity was investigated usingI2statistics and sensitivity analyses. Results: A total of 11 studies with 7207 participants were included in the meta‐analysis. Degree of EE was greater in adults with a BMI above the healthy range, compared to adults with a healthy BMI (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to0.45;I2= 85%). However, subgroup analysis found that degree of EE was greater only in adults with obesity (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.81;I2= 62%),and there was no difference in degree of EE between adults with overweight and those with a healthy BMI. Conclusions: Degree of EE is greater among adults living with obesity, compared to adults with a healthy BMI, indicating a need for behavioural support to support EE among people living with obesity seeking weight management.

The fluid flows owing to the horizontal temperature gradient in the presence of a vertical magnetic field. The main interest here is in the stability of the flow for a sufficiently strong magnetic field, for the Hartmann number Ha > 10, and increasing to high values, of the order of 103–104. The Prandtl number, Pr, has been fixed at Pr = 0.015. It is shown that besides the Hartmann number the instability strongly depends on the type of the thermal boundary conditions at the horizontal walls. For thermally conducting walls the basic temperature profile exhibits zones of unstable thermal stratification, which leads to instabilities owing to the Rayleigh-Bénard mechanism. However, the transitions between various, most unstable modes as Ha increases are not trivial. For sufficiently high values of Ha, the most unstable mode consists of transverse oscillatory rolls located in the region of unstable stratification. For thermally insulating walls, the transitions are simpler, and for sufficiently high Ha, the most unstable mode consists of longitudinal, steady, three-dimensional mode which is concentrated in the Hartmann layers at the horizontal boundaries. This mode has a combined dynamic-thermal origin and is owed to a strong shear in the Hartmann layers. The electrical boundary conditions do not qualitatively affect the picture of transitions between modes for both thermally conducting and thermally insulating walls.\\nPublisher Statement: This article may be downloaded for personal use only.

       "  'abstract': 'This study investigates the role of gender diversity in fraud commission and detection with a view to identifying whether companies with more female corporate leaders are less likely to be involved in financial statement fraud. Using a bivariate probit model, the role of female corporate leaders in financial statement fraud commission and detection is examined for Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2018. The representation of female corporate leaders increases the likelihood of fraud detection, thus reducing firms’ propensity to engage in fraud. The finding confirms that women are risk averse and more committed to ethical practices than men in corporate leadership positions. Moreover, this impact of gender diversity is contingent upon the nature of ultimate controllers of listed companies: more female representation in top leadership roles can mitigate fraud commission or detect fraud effectively in non-state-owned enterprises, but not in state-owned enterprises. In addition, the recent anti-corruption campaign initiated by Chinese President Jinping Xi is a powerful form of public governance. Female corporate leaders play a more positive role in mitigating fraud commission and detecting fraud commission in the post-campaign period than in the pre-campaign period.',\n",

(ii) Comparison of annual service performance and quality indicators indicated large increases in one-to-one contacts (89%) and carer assessments (21%). Indicators showed no detriment to quality of contacts (ranging from +4% to -1%) plus a 13% increase in contacts leading to reduced stress. (iii) 152 carers completing the survey had similar demographics to all registered carers. Computer proficiency scored were high. The online services most highly rated were carer’s wellbeing assessment, support needs checks, and peer support groups. 29% reported they had joined an online group activity, most frequently training and resilience courses. Thematic analysis of open-text responses identified three main aspects for future digital service development: ‘Things to help me use digital services in future’, ‘Offering selection of wellbeing services, including online’ and ‘Tailoring services’.\\n\\nConclusions:\\n\\nThe pandemic increased the number of carers requiring support. The resulting greater number of contacts were handled by introducing online services without obvious detriment to service performance or quality. Client surveys indicated a desire for a blended service (offering both face-to-face and online options). Considering the economic importance of unpaid carers nationally, more attention should be given as part of any future digital strategy to organisations funded to provide support for carers.

Given the lack of research on weight bias within obesity services, this study aimed to explore implicit bias among obesity specialist HCPs and explore views on non-weight focused approaches.\\nMETHODS: Obesity specialist HCPs were invited to a webinar, \"An exploration of non-weight focused approaches within bariatric services\", held in October 2021. Implicit weight bias was examined using the BiasProof mobile device test, based on the Implicit Association Test. Poll data was analysed descriptively, and qualitative data was analysed using framework analysis.\\nFINDINGS: 82 of the 113 HCPs who attended the webinar consented to contribute data to the study. Over half (51%) had an implicit weight bias against PLwO. Most (90%) agreed/strongly agreed that obesity services are too weight focused and that patients should not be weighed at every appointment (86%). Perceived benefits of taking a non-weight focused approach included patient-led care, reducing stigma and supporting patient wellbeing, while perceived barriers included loss of objectivity, inducing risk and difficulty demonstrating effectiveness.\\nINTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that half of obesity specialists HCPs in our sample of 82 providers, who are primarily dieticians and psychologists, have an implicit weight bias against PLwO. HCPs feel that a weight-focused approach within services was a barrier to patient care, but that there is a lack of alternative non-weight focused measures. Further research is needed into substitute outcome measures for clinical practice, also seeking the views of PLwO, and into interventions to address implicit weight bias.\\nFUNDING: Johnson & Johnson funded the BiasProof licence and publication open access charge.',\n",

The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of home-based training involving auditory cueing of stepping in place. Methods: Twelve community-dwelling participants with chronic hemiparesis completed two 3-week blocks of home-based stepping to music overlaid with an auditory metronome. Tempo of the metronome was increased 5% each week. One 3-week block used a regular metronome, whereas the other 3-week block had phase shift perturbations randomly inserted to cue stepping adjustments. results: All participants reported that they enjoyed training, with 75% completing all training blocks. No adverse events were reported. Walking speed, Timed Up and Go (TUG) time and Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) scores (median [inter-quartile range]) significantly improved between baseline (speed = 0.61 [0.32, 0.85] m⋅s−1 ; TUG = 20.0 [16.0, 39.9] s; DGI = 14.5 [11.3, 15.8]) and post stepping training (speed = 0.76 [0.39, 1.03] m⋅s−1 ; TUG = 16.3 [13.3, 35.1] s; DGI = 16.0 [14.0, 19.0]) and was maintained at follow-up (speed = 0.75 [0.41, 1.03] m⋅s−1 ; TUG = 16.5 [12.9, 34.1] s; DGI = 16.5 [13.5, 19.8]). conclusion: This pilot study suggests that auditory-cued stepping conducted at home was feasible and well-tolerated by participants post-stroke, with improvements in walking and functional mobility.

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Internationally, there is increasing emphasis on early support for pregnant women to optimize the health and development of mothers and newborns. To increase intervention reach, digital and app-based interventions have been advocated. There are growing numbers of pregnancy health care apps with great variation in style, function, and objectives, but evidence about impact on pregnancy well-being and behavior change following app interaction is lacking. This paper reports on the qualitative arm of the independent multicomponent study exploring the use and outcomes of first-time mothers using the Baby Buddy app, a pregnancy and parenting support app, available in the National Health Service App Library and developed by a UK child health and well-being charity, Best Beginnings. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand when, why, and how first-time mothers use the Baby Buddy app and the perceived benefits and challenges. METHODS: This paper reports on the qualitative arm of an independent, longitudinal, mixed methods study. An Appreciative Inquiry qualitative approach was used with semistructured interviews (17/60, 28%) conducted with new mothers, either by telephone or in a focus group setting. First-time mothers were recruited from 3 study sites from across the United Kingdom. Consistent with the Appreciative Inquiry approach, mothers were prompted to discuss what worked well and what could have been better regarding their interactions with the app during pregnancy. Thematic analysis was used, and findings are presented as themes with perceived benefits and challenges. RESULTS: The main benefit, or what worked well, for first-time mothers when using the app was being able to access new information, which they felt was reliable and easy to find. This led to a feeling of increased confidence in the information they accessed, thus supporting family and professional communication. The main challenge was the preference for face-to-face information with a health care professional, particularly around specific issues that they wished to discuss in depth. What could have been improved included that there were some topics that some mothers would have preferred in more detail, but in other areas, they felt well-informed and thus did not feel a need to seek additional information via an app. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study included a small sample, it elicited rich data and insights into first-time mothers' app interactions. The findings suggest that easily accessible pregnancy information, which is perceived as reliable, can support first-time mothers in communicating with health care professionals. Face-to-face contact with professionals was preferred, particularly to discuss specific and personalized needs. Further studies on maternal and professional digital support preferences after the COVID-19 global pandemic and how they facilitate antenatal education and informed decision-making are recommended, particularly because digital solutions remain as a key element in pregnancy and early parenting care.

While farmers need to invest in their farms, they struggle to find credit schemes adapted to their specific needs. This study explores the literature on a range of credit systems applied in different geographical and historical contexts to analyse the underlying drivers of their successes or otherwise. In light of this review, the study investigates a farmers’ association, Alfredo Namitete (AN), in Mozambique, offering a range of agroecology credit modalities. It is then assessed as to whether a new business model initiated with seed funding could be self-managed by the association itself and lead to greater autonomy. The AN pilot tested three schemes between 2015 and 2019. Based on the findings, i.e., better production, increased revenue and greater self-determination, the study combines elements for a new business model for small-scale lending. It concludes that to be effective, a credit scheme needs to meet several conditions simultaneously: believe in the genuine will to repay, abolish the lender–borrower distance, ensure a role for women in decision making, add a savings mechanism, combine individual and collective investments and, finally, reserve funds for solidarity and climate issues.',\n",

Limited data suggest that starting earlier is not detrimental, but clinical trials are needed. Objective: To compare the effectiveness and safety of CR exercise training started either 2 weeks (early CR) or 6 weeks (usual-care CR) after sternotomy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was an assessor-blind, noninferiority, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial that conducted participant recruitment from June 12, 2017, to March 17, 2020. Participants were consecutive cardiac surgery sternotomy patients recruited from 2 outpatient National Health Service rehabilitation centers: University Hospital, Coventry, UK, and Hospital of St Cross, Rugby, UK. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of twice-weekly supervised CR exercise training starting either 2 weeks (early CR) or 6 weeks (usual-care CR) after sternotomy. Exercise training adhered to existing guidelines, including functional strength and cardiovascular components. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were assessed at baseline (inpatient after surgery), after CR (10 or 14 weeks after sternotomy), and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome was the change in 6-minute walk test distance from baseline to after CR. Secondary outcomes included safety, functional fitness, and quality of life. Results: A total of 158 participants (mean [SD] age, 63 [11.5] years, 133 male patients [84.2%]) were randomly assigned to study groups; 118 patients (usual-care CR, 61 [51.7%]; early CR, 57 [48.3%]) were included in the primary analysis. Early CR was not inferior to usual-care CR (noninferiority margin, 35 m); the mean change in 6-minute walk distance from baseline to after CR was 28 m greater in the early CR group (95% CI, -11 to 66; P =.16). Mean differences for secondary outcomes were not statistically significant, indicating noninferiority of early CR. There were 46 vs 58 adverse events and 14 vs 18 serious adverse events in usual-care CR and early CR, respectively. There was no difference between the groups in the likelihood of participants having an adverse or serious adverse event. Conclusions and Relevance: Starting exercise training from 2 weeks after sternotomy was as effective as starting 6 weeks after sternotomy for improving 6-minute walk distance. With appropriate precautions, clinicians and CR professionals can consider starting exercise training as early as 2 weeks after sternotomy.

Objective To establish the variation and effectiveness of LRDs utilized in clinical practice. Setting A nationwide, multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Methods A total of 1699 adult patients across 14 bariatric centers in the United Kingdom were included. Multilevel logistic regression models were developed to examine factors predictive of 5% weight loss. Results Most centers (n = 9) prescribed an 800- to 1000-kcal diet, but the duration and formulation of diet was variable. Overall, 30.6% (n = 510) of patients achieved 5% weight loss during the LRD. After adjustment for preoperative weight, women had reduced odds (odds ratio [OR], .65; 95% confidence interval [CI], .48–.88; P = .005), while increasing age (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.02; P = .043) and having type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.16–1.92; P = .002) increased odds of 5% weight loss. A normal consistency food LRD (OR, .64; 95% CI, .42–.98; P = .041) and energy prescription of >1200 kcals/d (OR, .33; 95% CI, .13–.83; P = .019) reduced odds, while an LRD with a duration of 3 weeks (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.02–5.09; P = .044) or greater increased odds of 5% weight loss. Conclusions There is wide variation in how LRDs are delivered in clinical practice, highlighting the need for an evidence-based consensus. Our findings suggest the optimal LRD before bariatric surgery contains 800 to 1200 kcals/d over a duration of 3 to 4 weeks.

We hypothesize that firms utilizing financial derivative instruments reduce the stock return volatility which is priced in investors’ expectations. While financial risk hedging serves as a vehicle for firms to alleviate cash flows volatility, it also leads to economic benefits to the firm value in case of the presence of increasing asymmetric information. In addition, we hypothesize and test whether the nature of relation between financial risk hedging and cost of equity capital varies and is more negative or more ambiguous with economic shocks. Our results show that engaging in financial risk hedging enables firms to have a lower cost of capital. Consistent with the extant literature, we control for potential endogeneity problems and sample selection bias using instrumental variables and treatment effects approaches. Thus, our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, including the use of multiple estimation methods and alternative proxies of cost of equity measures. Overall, our findings suggest that the value of financial hedging decisions increases during economic shocks, and if financial constraints become more severe and if cash flows volatility increases.',\n",

Previous research has suggested that auditory cueing reduces excessive variability in conditions such as Parkinson's disease and post-stroke hemiparesis. The aim of this case report was to investigate whether the use of a metronome cue during walking could reduce excessive variability in gait parameters after a cerebellar stroke. An elderly female with a history of cerebellar stroke and recurrent falling undertook three standard gait trials and three gait trials with an auditory metronome. A Vicon system was used to collect 3-D marker trajectory data. The coefficient of variation was calculated for temporal and spatial gait parameters. SDs of the joint angles were calculated and used to give a measure of joint kinematic variability. Step time, stance time, and double support time variability were reduced with metronome cueing. Variability in the sagittal hip, knee, and ankle angles were reduced to normal values when walking to the metronome. In summary, metronome cueing resulted in a decrease in variability for step, stance, and double support times and joint kinematics. Further research is needed to establish whether a metronome may be useful in gait rehabilitation after cerebellar stroke and whether this leads to a decreased risk of falling.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This study uses face-to-face administered questionnaires to examine consumer behaviour in relation to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of 21 popular apparel companies in the UK. The results show that consumers' awareness of CSR practices and the impact of CSR factors on their purchasing decisions are low, which are key obstacles for companies to reap strategic rewards for their CSR efforts. CSR factors have less influence on consumers’ purchasing decisions than other product attributes; however, consumers have high expectations of companies’ CSR practices. Consumers expect companies to engage in CSR initiatives that benefit local communities, employees, and workers in suppliers’ factories.\\n\\nThis paper provides key insights for UK apparel companies to engage their customers and gain competitive advantage for their CSR efforts. With these insights, companies are better informed on consumers’ perceptions and expectations of CSR to benchmark against competitors, and to improve their CSR practices. This research has important implications for UK apparel marketers and policy makers.\",\n",

Yet, they continue to experience barriers when trying to access palliative and end of life care (PEOLC). Little research has been carried out which includes the views and experiences of people with SMI, and this study presents first findings which include people with both SMI and an incurable condition and their carers. It aimed to seek their views, and those of their carers, on their experiences and expectations of accessing PEOLC and to understand how PEOLC for people with SMI could be improved.\\n\\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 8 participants (5 patient participants and 3 carer participants). Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was undertaken.\\n\\nFindings: Four over-arching themes were developed. (1) Stigma and Prejudice – See Me, Not My Diagnosis (2) Hesitancy and Avoidance – Treading on Eggshells (3) Collaborators in Care – The Ignored Experts and (4) Connections – Leaning in, Not Stepping Back.\\n\\nSignificance of Findings: This study presents the first accounts from the UK concerning experiences of PEOLC, barriers to access and how care can be improved, from the perspectives of patients with both a SMI and an incurable physical condition and their carers. The findings illuminate an under-researched area of clinical practice and contribute rich understandings to future service developments and innovations.',\n",

Two reviewers independently appraised articles, systematically extracted data and assessed the quality of individual studies and reviews (using GRADE and AMSTAR-2, respectively). Thematic analysis used for evidence synthesis; no quantitative meta-analysis conducted. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017073067).\\nResults: Seven new randomised controlled trials, nine observational studies, and three quasi-experimental or pilot studies were identified (n = 854 participants). 75% utilised validated measures to record changes in facial function and/or patient-rated outcomes. High-quality trials (4/7) all reported positive impacts; as did observational studies rated as high/moderate quality (3/9). The benefit of therapy at different time points post-onset and for cases of varying clinical severity is discussed. Differences in study design prevented data pooling to strengthen estimates of therapy effects. Six new review articles identified were all rated critically low quality.\\nConclusion: The findings of this targeted review reinforce those of the earlier more general Cochrane review. New research studies strengthen previous conclusions about the benefits of facial exercise therapy early in recovery and add to evidence of the value in chronic cases.

Using a sample of Indonesian firms, we find that political connections are negatively related to accrual-based (AEM) and real (REM) earnings management. In addition, the negative relationship between political connections and earnings management is more pronounced in better-governed firms and those audited by one of the Big 4 auditors. The results are robust to alternative measures of earnings management, endogeneity, and subsample tests.

The project saw the restoration of the nature reserve’s heritage features – its landmark war memorial, rare design of flagpole and work on the Joseph Scott tree plantation. The grant was also used to increase the number of activities - to help visitors, schools and colleges make the most of Barr Beacon. This chapter will examine the meeting of technology and heritage in this innovative case study, and consider what lessons can be learned. A key aspect of the project was digital interpretation: a series of films were produced about the project, the site and the various events taking place; a web site and a mobile phone app were also developed and social media platforms were utilized to reach the community. The project team developed high quality media products and the films were aired on local television. Challenges included limited council resources to work on the project and the inflexibility of a long term project to adapt to a changing media landscape. As the project progressed, the media landscaped changed with spreadable media (Jenkins, Ford, Green 2013) becoming a more dominant cultural form. This required a transmedia strategy and the intentional creation of media that could spread virally. Whilst ‘Raising the Barr’ was considered a ‘wholehearted success’ by project evaluators NW Environmental Ltd (2016), lessons learned can be a translated into models of working for new projects.\",\n",

Different cracking behaviors were detected depending on the thermal treatment condition (i.e., horizontal cracks within the ceramic layer and at the thermally grown oxide (TGO)/YSZ interface) which can be related to stresses developed through thermal expansion mismatch and increased TGO thickness beyond a critical value, respectively. A reduction in hardness of bond coat (BC) was measured by nanoindentation and linked with the thermally activated grain growth mechanism. The hardness and elastic modulus of ceramic layers (GZ and YSZ) showed an increased trend after treatment that contributed to the interfacial cracks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (BMS) is a popular weight loss intervention worldwide, yet few scientific studies have examined variations in preoperative practices globally. This study aimed to capture global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients planned for BMS. Methods: A 41-item questionnaire-based survey was designed and the survey link was freely distributed on social and scientific media platforms, email groups and circulated through personal connections of authors. The survey included eight parts: basic information; criteria for BMS; preoperative nutritional screening; preoperative weight loss; preoperative diets for liver size reduction; preoperative glycemic control; other laboratory investigations and preparations; decision making, education, and consents. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data and graphs were used for representation where applicable. Results: Six hundred thirty-four bariatric healthcare professionals from 76 countries/regions completed the survey. Of these, n = 310 (48.9%) were from public hospitals, n = 466 (73.5%) were surgeons, and the rest were multidisciplinary professionals. More than half of respondents reported using local society/association guidelines in their practice (n = 310, 61.6%). The great majority of respondents routinely recommend nutritional screening preoperatively (n = 385, 77.5%), mandatory preoperative diets for liver size reduction (n = 220, 53.1%), routine screening for T2DM (n = 371, 90.7%), and mandate a glycemic control target before BMS in patients with T2DM (n = 203, 55.6%). However, less than half (n = 183, 43.9%) recommend mandatory preoperative weight loss to all patients. Most respondents (n = 296, 77.1%) recommend psychological intervention before surgery for patients diagnosed with psychological conditions. Variations were also identified in laboratory investigations and optimisation; and in the aspects of decision making, education and consent. Conclusions: This survey identified significant global variations in preoperative practices concerning patients seeking primary BMS. Our findings could facilitate future research for the determination of best practice in these areas of variations, and consensus-building to guide clinical practice while we wait for that evidence to emerge.',\n",

In Paralympic competition, classes are combined by using a factoring adjustment to race times to produce the overall medallists. Pacing in short-duration track cycling events is proposed to utilize an \"all-out\" strategy in able-bodied competition. However, pacing in para-cycling may vary depending on the level of impairment. Analysis of the pacing strategies employed by different classification groups may offer scope for optimal performance; therefore, this study investigated the pacing strategy adopted during the 1-km time trial (TT) and 500-m TT in elite C1 to C3 para-cyclists and able-bodied cyclists. Total times and intermediate split times (125-m intervals; measured to 0.001 s) were obtained from the C1-C3 men\\'s 1-km TT (n = 28) and women\\'s 500-m TT (n = 9) from the 2012 Paralympic Games and the men\\'s 1-km TT (n = 19) and women\\'s 500-m TT (n = 12) from the 2013 UCI World Track Championships from publically available video. Split times were expressed as actual time, factored time (for the para-cyclists) and as a percentage of total time. A two-way analysis of variance was used to investigate differences in split times between the different classifications and the able-bodied cyclists in the men\\'s 1-km TT and between the para-cyclists and able-bodied cyclists in the women\\'s 500-m TT. The importance of position at the first split was investigated with Kendall\\'s Tau-b correlation. The first 125-m split time was the slowest for all cyclists, representing the acceleration phase from a standing start. C2 cyclists were slowest at this 125-m split, probably due to a combination of remaining seated in this acceleration phase and a high proportion of cyclists in this group being trans-femoral amputees. Not all cyclists used aero-bars, preferring to use drop, flat or bullhorn handlebars. Split times increased in the later stages of the race, demonstrating a positive pacing strategy. In the shorter women\\'s 500-m TT, rank at the first split was more strongly correlated with final position than in the longer men\\'s 1-km TT.

       "  'abstract': 'Background:\\n\\nFacial nerve paralysis (FNP) is the most common sudden onset disorder affecting a single nerve, leaving patients unable to move muscles on the affected side of the face. Patients with FNP may experience challenges in accessing facial neuromuscular retraining (NMR), a therapy used to increase muscle and improve nerve function health care. Access and therapy delivery could potentially be improved via telerehabilitation. However, there is limited research on patients’ and clinicians’ experiences of FNP treatment pathways, or their views about the benefits of digital technology to assist NMR.\\n\\nObjective:\\n\\nThis study aimed to gather evidence about FNP treatment pathways in the UK, barriers to accessing NMR, factors influencing patient adherence, measures used to monitor recovery, and the potential value of an emerging wearable digital technology.\\n\\nMethods:\\n\\nNational surveys of (1) facial palsy patients and (2) facial therapy specialists to gather evidence. Questionnaires were co-designed with users, and followed a similar format to enable cross-referencing of responses. A follow-on survey (3) of national specialists investigated outcomes used to monitor recovery in greater detail. Analysis of closed questions dependent on data distribution; open text responses analysed using thematic content analysis.\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nNational survey responses included (1) 216 facial palsy patients and (2) 25 specialist therapists. Significant variations observed in treatment pathways. Evidence of more rapid initial prescribing of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and earlier referral for NMR therapy in cases diagnosed more recently. Patients report 3·27 (SD=1.60) treatments provided by different specialists, but multidisciplinary team reviews are rare. Barriers to NMR referral include difficulties accessing funding, shortage of specialist therapists, and limited awareness of NMR amongst general practitioners (GPs); 33% of GP referrals initiated by patients themselves. Patients travel long distance to reach an NMR specialist centre; 8.6% travel ≥ 115 miles. Thematic content analysis demonstrates positive attitudes to the introduction of digital technology among patients and clinicians, with similar incentives and barriers identified by both. Follow-on survey (3) 28 specialists show no consistency in measures used to monitor recovery, or in the definitions of a clinically significant change. Three main barriers to NMR adherence are identified by therapists and patients, all of which can be addressed by a suitable digital technology.\\n\\nConclusions:\\n\\nThis study provides evidence on patients’ and clinicians’ experiences of FNP treatment pathways, and their views on the value of digital technology to enhance provision of NMR and improve outcomes. Possible ways in which the emerging digital technology can improve therapy provision and provide more rigorous evidence on effectiveness are described. The study highlights the need to better understand patients’ and clinicians’ experiences. It is suggested that one legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be lower organisational barriers to this digital technology introduction, especially if cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.

       "  'abstract': 'Anthropogenic global warming (AGW) requires net-zero human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to stabilize the climate. As achieving zero emissions is unrealistic, offsetting is necessary to achieve net-zero (emissions minus offsets). Organizations need to become carbon-neutral, both by reducing emissions and by removing atmospheric CO2. However, much of the language used in discourse surrounding carbon-neutrality and net-zero is vague; more rigorous definitions are required. Currently, emissions are “neutralized” through “deemed offsets,” which can include GHG sinks, reductions, and allowance schemes. Metrics are employed to determine offsetting amounts.\\nWe extend current practice using a “do no harm” principle to better account for different GHGs’ climate impacts. We examine emissions reduction and the appropriate use of offsetting, including challenges such as carbon storage robustness. We illustrate these guidelines using the PAS 2060 carbon-neutrality standard.\\nIn summary, while offsetting is required for climate stabilization, schemes differ in their capacity to halt AGW. High-quality offsetting is required to stabilize warming; we discuss key physical considerations.',\n",

There is increasing evidence of the benefits of the use of computer and mobile technology (labelled as eHealth hereafter) including serious gaming and gamification in many clinical areas. We aimed to conduct a systematic review of such interventions designed to improve self-management skills, treatment adherence and clinical outcomes in young kidney transplant recipients aged 16 to 30 years.\\nMethod: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS and CINAHL databases were searched for studies published between 01 January 1990 and 20 October 2020. Articles were short-listed by two independent reviewers based on pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Reference lists were screened and authors of published conference abstracts contacted. Two reviewers independently appraised selected articles, systematically extracted data and assessed the quality of individual studies (CASP and SORT). Thematic analysis was used for evidence synthesis; quantitative meta-analysis was not possible.\\nResults: A total of 1,098 unique records were identified. Short-listing identified four eligible studies, all randomized controlled trials (n=266 participants). Trials mainly focused on mHealth applications or electronic pill dispensers (mostly for patients >18 years old). Most studies reported on clinical outcome measures. All showed improved adherence but there were no differences in the number of rejections. Study quality was low for all four studies.\\nConclusions: The findings of this review suggest that eHealth interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes for young kidney transplant patients. More robust and high-quality studies are now needed to validate these findings. Future studies should also extend beyond short-term outcomes, and consider cost of implementation.

Since TMT members differ in their cognitive structures, as also acknowledged by the presence of managerial biases and irrationalities in the behavioural finance theories, policy makers and scholars are saddled with the problem of identifying specific cognitive elements that can secure optimum organisational outcomes. Conceptual approaches or linear relationships between TMT strategic cognition (TMT-SC) and outcomes are unable to capture the complex interdependencies among TMT-SC, TMT attributes and performance. We propose and empirically test a dynamic multi-dimensional TMT-SC model. Using handpicked UK company panel data, we provide robust empirical evidence that extends our understanding of the theory. Our PLS-SEM analyses show that heterogeneity in TMT academic and professional qualifications, and work experience alone cannot provide optimal benefits to organisations. However, when they are combined with other TMT cognitive factors such as social networking, innovativeness and risk-taking levels, these aspects appear to improve firm value and financial health.',\n",

Elevated temperature tensile testing across a range of strain rates (5 × 10−4s−1 × 10−1 s−1) and three temperatures (450− 500 °C) to compare material ductility followed by gas bulge testing at 475 °C and two gas pressures to investigate formability in a test closer to industrial forming conditions. Material strength was established using standard tensile testing, and EBSD used to understand the microstructural evolution of the materials. It was seen that the nickel additions increased ductility of the material across all test conditions, coupled with increasing the material strength. This was achieved due to the formation of nickel rich intermetallics which refine the microstructure during pre-heating through particle stimulated nucleation and subsequently improve strength through precipitation hardening in aging treatments.

       "  'abstract': 'Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is more common in women of reproductive age who have obesity, yet there is little information on its management specifically in pregnancy. Women with IIH should plan their pregnancy including discussing contraception before pregnancy, recognising that hormonal contraceptives are not contraindicated. Potentially teratogenic medications including acetazolamide and topiramate are not recommended during pregnancy or in those with immediate plans to conceive; prescribing acetazolamide in pregnancy must only follow discussion with the patient and their obstetrician. Ideally, patients should aim to achieve disease remission or control before pregnancy, through optimising their weight. Although weight gain is expected in pregnancy, excessive weight gain may exacerbate IIH and increase maternal and fetal complications; evidence-based recommendations for non-IIH pregnancies may help in guiding optimal gestational weight gain. The vast majority of women with IIH can have a normal vaginal delivery, with spinal or epidural anaesthesia if needed, provided the papilloedema is stable or the IIH is in remission.

Cueing using audio metronomes has been shown to improve gait, but can be impractical when interacting with others, particularly outdoors where awareness of vehicles and bicycles is essential. Audio is also unsuitable in environments with high background noise, or for those with a hearing impair- ment. If successful, lightweight portable tactile cueing has the potential to take the benefits of cueing out of the laboratory and into everyday life. The Haptic Bracelets are lightweight wireless devices containing a computer, accelerome- ters and low-latency vibrotactiles with a wide dynamic range. In this paper we review gait rehabilitation problems and existing solutions, and present an early pilot in which the Haptic Bracelets were applied to post-stroke gait rehabilita- tion.

This study contributes to this debate by examining the relationship between board leadership structure and firm performance and the expense ratio, using propensity-score matching methods for Chinese PLCs from 2003–2010. It is reported that whilst CEO duality is not related to companies' profitability ratios, it is linked to a higher expense ratio compared to matched companies with a separate board leadership structure.

Therefore, it is critically important to explore stroke/TIA knowledge and anticipated response to symptoms, within this community.\\n\\nAim This study aims to provide preliminary evidence of stroke knowledge and awareness of the relaunched ‘Act FAST’ campaign in the South Asian community and to provide evidence of successful participant recruitment from ‘hard to engage’ groups.\\n\\nMethod A pilot mixed methods study, incorporating focus group discussions and a short ‘tick box’ style paper survey, designed to assess and explore participant knowledge of stroke/TIA symptoms, and awareness of the relaunched ‘Act FAST’ campaign.

Severe Mental Health problems include psychosis, bipolar disorder, personality disorder and eating disorders. Upskilling the workforce is central to improving access to psychological therapies.\\nIntroduction: In Autumn 2021, Health Education England established a commissioned evaluation of the national provision of training for psychological therapies for severe mental health problems, known as the PTSMHP National Curriculum Delivery. A research team from Coventry University were commissioned to undertake this work.\\nAim and objective of evaluation: To evaluate the current national PTSMHP training provision in relation to five parameters: Reach, Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, Results.\\nDesign and methods: A mixed method evaluation, applying the Kirkpatrick framework and appreciative enquiry. Data collection took place between January-May 2022 and involved three stages. Stage 1 involved desk review of course provision. Stage 2 saw the distribution of an online questionnaire survey to trainees on commissioned courses. Stage 3 involved interviews and focus groups with HEE regional managers, education provider course teams, NHS Clinical leads and trainees.\\nResults: The desk review was undertaken with education providers in relation to 22 courses and 9 types of course. Questionnaire responses were received from 144 trainees whilst interviews and focus groups involved 69 respondents.\\nReach – HEE offered out 1575 training places between 2021-22 (see page 68 for breakdown). All courses planned within the PTSMHP offer between 2020-22 were delivered. Thirteen education providers deliver the training and course teams report that training capacity has been reached within some of these organisations.\\nReaction - Responses to the training offer have been highly positive, with training described as high quality, engaging and relevant. Online delivery has been well received.\\nLearning - Trainees identified specific examples of their learning and application to their roles with clients and service provision. Factors facilitating the ability to learn include workplace support, study time and supervision.\\nBehaviour - Trainees explained how they had improved their practice with clients, and some had used their new skills and knowledge to establish new service provision. Training generated increased job satisfaction, motivation for work, and personal confidence.\\nResults - The evaluation suggests the training provision is making a significant contribution to capability and capacity, including increasing the pool of supervisors to support further trainees. The evaluation did not assess changes in service user choice.\\n\\nConclusions Trainees and NHS clinical leaders indicated extremely high satisfaction with all training provided within the PTSMHP course offer. Courses appear to have lasting effects, informing trainees’ daily practices with clients, building confidence and competence, and inducing job satisfaction and improved motivation towards work. The PTSMHP training programme if developed and strengthened further will continue to comprise an important catalyst for service improvement.',\n",

Method: (i) Longitudinal analysis of fully anonymised routinely collected data on 20,237 carers over the period January 2019 - June 2021. Including impact on number of registered carers, number of contacts, move from face-to-face to remote (digital/telephone) access, and types of service accessed. (ii) Comparison of service performance and quality indicators for financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21. (iii) Client survey to include: digital services accessed; barriers/facilitators to access; computer proficiency (CPQ-12); and views on online services. Quantitative data analysed utilising Stata 13. Thematic analysis used for open-text responses.\\n\\nResults:\\n\\n(i) Monthly contacts increased from 2,000 to 6,500. Remote contacts rose from 1,300 to 5,500 per month (growing from 65% to 85% of total); digital contacts increasing from 500 to 2,300. Pre-pandemic, remote contacts were exclusively by email or text. Distinct patterns were observed for digital uptake by city versus rural carers. (ii) Comparison of annual service performance and quality indicators indicated large increases in one-to-one contacts (89%) and carer assessments (21%). Indicators showed no detriment to quality of contacts (ranging from +4% to -1%) plus a 13% increase in contacts leading to reduced stress. (iii) 152 carers completing the survey had similar demographics to all registered carers. Computer proficiency scored were high. The online services most highly rated were carer’s wellbeing assessment, support needs checks, and peer support groups. 29% reported they had joined an online group activity, most frequently training and resilience courses. Thematic analysis of open-text responses identified three main aspects for future digital service development: ‘Things to help me use digital services in future’, ‘Offering selection of wellbeing services, including online’ and ‘Tailoring services’.\\n\\nConclusions:\\n\\nThe pandemic increased the number of carers requiring support. The resulting greater number of contacts were handled by introducing online services without obvious detriment to service performance or quality. Client surveys indicated a desire for a blended service (offering both face-to-face and online options). Considering the economic importance of unpaid carers nationally, more attention should be given as part of any future digital strategy to organisations funded to provide support for carers.

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction: In the United Kingdom (UK), 23,000 people annually are diagnosed with facial palsy (acute onset facial paralysis). For nearly one third this will result in a permanent disability, including in some the inability to smile. In addition to initial pharmacological therapy, guidelines recommend tailored facial exercise (TFE) therapy repeated every day. However, not all patients are currently able to access such specialist physical therapy. ‘Smart specs’ (using miniaturized sensors in the frames to measure facial movement) are currently being developed. Linked to a smartphone, these could allow people to practice TFEs discreetly, provide immediate feedback, and supply data on outcomes to the patient and their clinician.Methods: Modelling of introduction of Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) into treatment pathways for patients with facial palsy. This included: (i) review on effectiveness of TFE therapy; (ii) national surveys (medical staff, facial therapy specialists and patients) to gather data on access to TFE therapy; (iii) Delphi Exercise to identify consensus on key outcome measures; and, (iv) economic modelling to estimate cost-effectiveness and determine a range of acceptable costs for the technology. In parallel, research to examine target markets to inform product development, and production of integral commercialization plan. Results: Searches short-listed ten studies to add to the three included in the 2011 Cochrane review. Surveys indicate approximately thirteen percent of eligible UK patients access personalized TFE therapy. Estimated annual expenditure on hospital treatments for facial palsy patients is currently GBP >80 million (>USD 106 million) compared with <£0.5 million (<USD 0.66 million) on TFE therapy. Patients with permanent defects can suffer a loss of up to two quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).Conclusions: Findings from this study, particularly in relation to costs and benefits, will inform the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial. A novel wearable technology could make a major difference to people’s lives, as well as generating potential efficiencies for healthcare.',\n",

Using brand architecture as a framework, the research aims to examine: the brand names they adopt, markets they serve and the hierarchical relationship between the leagues and PSCs in the branding of the product ranges of both organizations.\\n\\nResearch methods: Set within the context of the English Football League (EFL), club websites were reviewed to examine brand names that are used when marketing activities unrelated to sport. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the commercial staff of 21 PSCs relating to their branding strategy.\\n\\nResults and findings: Leagues and PSCs may market a number of brands in addition to their core products of sporting competitions and teams. EFL clubs have developed brands independently of the league, primarily by branding their stadiums as a multi-purpose venue to stage events not related to matches. Within their venues they have also developed a category we term ‘stadium sub-brands’. These include business clubs, comedy clubs and restaurants. Some of these services are co-branded with partner organizations.\\n\\nImplications: Devising a typology of the brand architecture of EFL clubs illustrates how sports organizations can diversify into markets other than football and add to their product portfolio by making use of their resources, in particular their stadium.',\n",

It compares two very different case studies: women working at faith-based organizations in the UK and women working for secular organizations who travel for work to Saudi Arabia. Using 65 semi-structured interviews, participant wardrobe photographs, and observation in regional modest fashion retail, the article analyzes women workers’ experience in religious contexts as a form of aesthetic labor. It investigates the gendered and religious components which structure women’s different responses to workplace modesty codes. Detailing the additional aesthetic and emotional labor demanded of women in crafting modest professional appearances in religious contexts, the research reveals continuities in how workplace modesty requirements impact on women’s occupational performance and sense of self. The conclusion argues that religion-related workplace modesty codes constitute a religiously-inflected form of organisational aesthetics that may operate simultaneously with, but be experienced differently from, secular-driven organisational aesthetics. We find that religious dress codes are arbitrated by the avoidance of shame, an affect accompanying the government of modesty for all involved. We find that organisations benefit from, but do not recognise or recompense, the additional aesthetic labor that modesty demands of women.',\n",

To ensure smooth motion during such task reordering, a control scheme with a suitable task allocation algorithm is developed at the acceleration level. The proposed approach is validated with MATLAB simulations and an experimental evaluation using the 7-dof KUKA LWR manipulator.',\n",

We use a large dataset based on deals worldwide from over 140 countries during the period 1977–2014. Our core finding is that the likelihood of a deal's withdrawal tends to increase if the economic freedom/quality of legal environment of the acquiring (target) firm's country is higher (lower). These core findings matter more for the non‐financial sector, during non‐crisis years, and in developed financial markets. We also report that the deals have higher tendency to be withdrawn if the target firm's size is larger or its profitability is lower; and the acquiring firm's size is smaller. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that deal characteristics (i.e., deal attitude, means of payment, deal size, ownership sought) also matter in affecting the outcome of announced M&A deals.\",\n",

The aim of the current study was to compare COM-COP separation measures during walking between groups of older adults with no history of falling, and a history of falling due to tripping or slipping. Any differences between individuals who have fallen due to a slip and those who have fallen due to a trip in measures of dynamic balance could potentially indicate differences in the mechanisms responsible for falls. Forty older adults were allocated into groups based on their self-reported fall history during walking. The non-faller group had not experienced a fall in at least the previous year. Participants who had experienced a fall were split into two groups based on whether a trip or slip resulted in the fall(s). A Vicon system was used to collect full body kinematic trajectories. Two force platforms were used to measure ground reaction forces. The COM was significantly further ahead of the COP at heel strike for the trip (14.3 ± 2.7 cm) and slip (15.3 ± 1.1 cm) groups compared to the non-fallers (12.0 ± 2.7 cm). COM was significantly further behind the COP at foot flat for the slip group (-14.9 ± 3.6 cm) compared to the non-fallers (-10.3 ± 3.9 cm). At mid-swing, the COM of the trip group was ahead of the COP (0.9 ± 1.6 cm), whereas for the slip group the COM was behind the COP (-1.2 ± 2.2 cm). These results show identifiable differences in dynamic balance control of walking between older adults with a history of tripping or slipping and non-fallers.',\n",

One of these fundamental trips is the ski trip which enables young people to experience new challenges and adventure. However, within England and Wales, skiing is an atypical activity due to the lack of accessibility to the slopes. Consequently, it is vital to effectively prepare young people for skiing to promote enjoyment and reduce the likelihood of injury. The purpose of this study was to explore the current practices in the preparation of school ski trips within England and Wales. An electronic survey was administered to secondary schools across England and Wales with 270 completed responses of schools which organise ski trips. Analysis revealed that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) across the regions with information being shared with parents prior to the ski trip. Young people are informed on similar information prior to and during the ski trip across the regions (p < 0.05). However, there was a significant difference between respondents screening (33%) and not screening students (67%) (p > 0.01) and under half (47%) of schools provide their pupils with exercise programmes prior to the school trip. Overall, these findings appear that ski trip organisers are consistent across England and Wales with their education of the young person and the management of the ski trip. Although, the knowledge gained by organisers to prepare young people is gathered from a variety of different sources. Therefore, it is essential for evidence-based information to be shared and disseminated to ski trip organisers to provide best practice and to facilitate other schools in providing ski trips for their pupils.',\n",

High-quality trials (4/7) all reported positive impacts; as did observational studies rated as high/moderate quality (3/9).

This study applies panel data regression techniques to 10,639 firm-year observations of non-financial Chinese listed firms during 2003–2010 to examine the relationship between state ownership and firm performance. The results show that state ownership has a U-shaped relationship with firm performance. The Split Share Structure Reform in 2005–2006 played a positive role in enhancing the relationship between state ownership and firm profitability ratios. Although state ownership decreased significantly after 2006, it remains high in strategically important industry sectors such as the oil, natural gas and mining sector and the publishing, broadcasting and media sector. The findings reveal that a higher level of state ownership is superior to a dispersed ownership structure due to the benefits of government support and political connections. The Split Share Structure Reform made previously non-tradable shares legally tradable, improving corporate governance and reducing the negative effect of non-tradable state shares.

These treatments are not suitable for, acceptable to, or effective for everyone. Alpha-Stim AID is a cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) device with evidence of effectiveness in treating symptoms of anxiety. In this study, Alpha-Stim AID was offered through a United Kingdom (UK) universal community healthcare provider, Intermediate Care Team (ICT) community healthcare service to patients who reported signs of anxiety. Objective: The aim of this paper is to present feasibility findings and outcomes on anxiety, health status, and quality of life. Methods: Open-label patient cohort design, with no control group. Participants were adults who reported symptoms of anxiety and were under the care of universal national health service (NHS) Intermediate Care Team (ICT) community healthcare service in the United Kingdom (UK). Pre- and post-intervention assessment used participant self-report measures: generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7) and health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). The three ICT staff members who offered the Alpha-Stim AID to patients completed a questionnaire on their experience. Results: Eighteen patients used the Alpha-Stim and completed outcome measures. GAD-7 scores significantly improved from 13.9 (SD = 4.3) to 7.3 (SD = 5.7) (p < 0.001), with a large effect size of 0.88. Analysis of EQ-ED-5L health index score conversions indicated perceived quality of life increased from 0.31 (SD = 0.25) to 0.48 (SD = 0.28) at end (p = 0.036), with a small effect size of 0.12. EQ-VAS scores at baseline improved from 49.2 (SD = 24.0) to 64.4 (SD = 26.2) at the end (p = 0.05), with a small effect size of 0.12. Limitations: There was no control group, and the intervention was adjunct to existing treatments. Conclusions: Alpha-Stim AID CES can be offered through a UK NHS Trust Intermediate Care Team (ICT) community healthcare service and can have a significant positive impact on symptoms of anxiety, quality of life, and health status in patients who report experience of anxiety symptoms. Roll-out through community mental health providers to people with experience of anxiety symptoms is feasible.

The purpose of this trial is to compare CR exercise training commenced early (2 weeks post-surgery) with current usual care (6 weeks post-surgery) with a view to informing future CR guidelines for patients recovering from sternotomy.\\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this assessor-blind randomised controlled trial, 140 cardiac surgery patients, recovering from sternotomy, will be assigned to 8\\u2009weeks of twice-weekly supervised CR exercise training commencing at either 2\\u2009weeks (early CR) or 6 weeks (usual care CR) post-surgery. Usual care exercise training will adhere to current UK recommendations. Participants in the early CR group will undertake a highly individualised 2-3\\u2009week programme of functional mobility, strength and cardiovascular exercise before progressing to a usual care CR programme. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (inpatient), pre-CR (2 or 6 weeks post-surgery), post-CR (10 or 14 weeks post-surgery) and 12 months. The primary outcome will be change in 6\\u2009min walk distance. Secondary outcomes will include measures of functional fitness, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.\\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Recruitment commenced on July 2017 and will complete by December 2019.

       "  'abstract': 'High-entropy materials (HEM), including alloys, ceramics, and composites, are a novel class of materials that have gained enormous attention over the past two decades. These multi-component novel materials with unique structures always have exceptionally good mechanical properties and phase stability at all temperatures. Of particular interest for high-temperature applications, e.g., in the aerospace and nuclear sectors, is the new concept of high-entropy coatings (HEC) on low-cost metallic substrates, which has just emerged during the last few years. This exciting new virgin field awaits exploration by materials scientists and surface engineers who are often equipped with high-performance computational modelling tools, high-throughput coating deposition technologies and advanced materials testing/characterisation methods, all of which have greatly shortened the development cycle of a new coating from years to months/days. This review article reflects on research progress in the development and application of HEC focusing on high-temperature applications in the context of materials/composition type, coating process selection and desired functional properties. The importance of alloying addition is highlighted, resulting in suppressing oxidation as well as improving corrosion and diffusion resistance in a variety of coating types deposited via common deposition processes. This review provides an overview of this hot topic, highlighting the research challenges, identifying gaps, and suggesting future research activity for high temperature applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In response to the phenomenon of women converting to Islam, a body of research has emerged, engaging with the question, ‘Why are Western women, raised in liberal contexts, converting to Islam?’ This line of enquiry is not limited to academic literature. In recent years, converts to Islam have faced intense scrutiny in mainstream media across Europe. This article contributes an analysis of documentaries to the study of representations of female converts to Islam, focusing particularly on the British documentary Make Me a Muslim (2014) and the Swiss documentary Les Converties d’Allah (2017). We suggest that comparing these two documentaries illuminates certain common narrative threads in media representations of female converts to Islam across different European contexts. In this article, we firstly situate this research within existing literature on gender and conversion to Islam and outline our approach to the study of documentaries on women’s conversion to Islam. Secondly, we analyse the two documentaries, focusing on their shared concerns, namely gender equality and women’s oppression, and the familial environment of the female convert. We argue that paying attention to how female converts are represented illuminates some of the ways in which European framings of the ‘in-betweenness’ of female converts to Islam create notions of female converts as ‘vulnerable-fanatics’ prone to ‘radicalisation’, and threatened by ‘oppressive’ Islam. We demonstrate how female converts participating in documentaries at times complicate and talk back to apprehensions regarding equality, oppression and radicalisation. Finally, we focus in a similar way on understandings of female converts as ‘troublemakers’ within their family environments. Throughout the analysis, we show how the figure of the female convert as vulnerable-fanatic and as family troublemaker is gendered and interlaced with concerns about essentialised cultural difference and radicalisation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Communal rangelands are a global resource of significant benefit to society through the provision of critical ecosystem goods and services such as carbon sequestration, water and livestock forage. The relative importance of the ecosystem goods and services provided by communal rangelands is driven by the social and environmental priorities of a range of different stakeholders at the local, regional and national level. Understanding the potential ecosystem service trade-offs (and synergies) is vital for making informed and inclusive decisions as part of the process of stakeholder engagement, both in goal setting as well as evaluating the appropriateness of outcomes in rangelands. However, application of trade-offs approaches to communal rangelands, has frequently been limited by a lack of adequate stakeholder engagement to help define important factors such as the diverse objectives of end users and the broader institutional and policy environments that frame them. To help address this, we propose a framework that conceptualises the links between different actors and trade-offs at three key levels, using communal rangelands in South Africa as a case study. Firstly, we explore environment trade-offs between key ecosystem services, largely determined through public sector engagement in the formulation of environmental policy. Secondly, we examine the potential for environmental policies to create community-environment trade-offs between the needs of local communities and those of society more broadly. Thirdly, we consider community trade-offs reflecting the many different social and economic priorities of people living in communal systems. We suggest that the framework will find greatest application in the initial process of determining potential ecosystem service trade-offs and associated land use scenarios with key stakeholders, and then subsequently in connecting the trade-offs back to these stakeholders, following analysis, as part of a ‘discussion support’ process. We also discuss the broader applicability of this approach to rangelands systems outside of South Africa.',\n",

Positioning theory provides ways to interpret how the positioning is achieved through the mutual effects of storylines, speech acts, and positions (Van Langenhove & Harré 2003). We examine how male and female preachers position themselves when they advise parents about Islamic values in raising children. The sermon data is from a corpus of twenty online Islamic sermons on YouTube that engage with the theme of family. The sermons were delivered in different settings, such as in Friday services in the mosque or Islamic conferences in auditoriums in various countries, namely the USA, UK, Canada, Sri Lanka, and Qatar. The findings show that the preachers put themselves in a position of authority primarily through their expertise in quoting and interpreting authoritative sacred texts. Preachers' positioning is fluid; they position themselves as a person who delivers God's words, as storytellers, or take a more authoritative position by employing direct commands. It is common in Islamic communities for mothers to have responsibility to teach and raise children. In sermons, the preachers tell stories of paragons of Islamic parenting such as Luqman, male Biblical prophets, and stories of Muhammad to inspire fathers to play their role in helping mothers raise children.\\n\\nFirst Page\",\n",

These are: 1) artists reflecting on their own creative process and engaging other researchers in doing so, generating new insights and language as a result; 2) humanities-based dance studies and a small number of dance scholars reflecting on this “process turn” in dance; and 3) the field of empirical audience studies, drawing on a single study specifically interested in access to creative process. The goal is to propose how these areas might coexist and mutually inform each other.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach: The approach develops a three-fold framework where the multiple definitions and examples of reflexive research in dance-making processes coexist. It draws systematically on a detailed example of one self-reflective study conducted by a dance company into creative process, on new scholarly writing on the “process turn” in dance research and written analysis of a unique audience research project as well as related literature.\\n\\nFindings: In conclusion, the article suggests that in whatever combination of different research approaches, empirical evidence is increasingly important. This risks tipping the balance towards a more utilitarian understanding, particularly in the area of audience studies. It is possible to counterbalance this with approaches from artists and scholars interested in understanding arrived at through reflexive study of creative practice.\\n\\nOriginality/value: The original contribution is to bring these three areas together for the first time to expose difference and overlaps and suggest that challenges of understanding (in a non-utilitarian form) could be mitigated through more systematic dialogue between them, such as presented here.\\n\\nKeywords: Dance, Audiences, Audience studies, Choreographer, Dance studies, Reflexive research\\n\\nPaper type Conceptual paper',\n",

We consider the theory of non-linear real arithmetic where the formulae are logical combinations of polynomial constraints. Here a commonly used tool is the Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) to decompose real space into cells where the constraints are truth-invariant through the use of projection polynomials.\\nAn improved approach is to repackage the CAD theory into a search-based algorithm: one that guesses sample points to satisfy the formula, and generalizes guesses that conflict constraints to cylindrical cells around samples which are avoided in the continuing search. Such an approach can lead to a satisfying assignment more quickly, or conclude unsatisfiability with fewer cells. A notable example of this approach is Jovanović and de Moura's NLSAT algorithm. Since these cells are produced locally to a sample we might need fewer projection polynomials than the traditional CAD projection. The original NLSAT algorithm reduced the set a little; while Brown's single cell construction reduced it much further still. However, the shape and size of the cell produced depends on the order in which the polynomials are considered.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a method to construct such cells levelwise, i.e. built level-by-level according to a variable ordering. We still use a reduced number of projection polynomials, but can now consider a variety of different reductions and use heuristics to select the projection polynomials in order to optimise the shape of the cell under construction. We formulate all the necessary theory as a proof system: while not a common presentation for work in this field, it allows an elegant decoupling of heuristics from the algorithm and its proof of correctness.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background:\\n\\nLow energy diets (LEDs)(1000-1200kcal) and very low energy diets (VLEDs) (<800kcal) have been shown to significantly reduce liver size in preparation for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. However, pre-operative dietary practices vary considerably and research to date has not examined the efficacy of a range of pre-operative diets within clinical practice. Thus, our study aimed to establish the variation in, and efficacy of, pre-operative dietary regimes utilised in practice across the UK.\\n\\nMethods:\\n\\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent a primary bariatric procedure at 16 participating UK bariatric centres between 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. Patient demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity), diabetes status and weight at baseline and on the day of surgery was collected. We also collected data about the pre-operative diet regimes, including kcals/day and duration. A multilevel linear random effects model was developed to examine predictors of weight on day of surgery. Baseline weight, diabetes status, diet duration and kcals/day were included in the model.\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nA total of 2,092 patients were included in the analysis. Diets ranged from <800kcal to >1200kcals/day and lasted one week to ≥5 weeks. The most common diets followed by patients were 800-1000kcals (55.7%) and lasted 2 weeks (71.4%). The unadjusted mean weight loss across all patients was 5.43kg (95% CI 5.18 to 5.68). Weight on the day of surgery was, on average, 0.79kg less for patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (p=0.002), and also less for 4 week (1.90kg, p=0.035) and ≥5 week diets (3.54kg, p=0.001), compared to a 1 week diet. Patients on a <800kcals/day diet were, on average, 8.86kg lighter than >1200 Kcals/day diets on the day of surgery (p=0.016). There was no significant difference in weight between VLED of <800kcal/day diets and LEDs of either 800-1000kcal/day (p=0.194) or 1000-1200kcal/day (p=0.212).\\n\\nConclusions:\\n\\nA range of pre-operative diets are used in clinical practice in the UK, reflecting a need for standardised guidance in this area. Our study found that lower kcal and longer duration pre-operative diets were associated with greater pre-operative weight loss. Further research is required to confirm our findings that patients with diabetes respond better to pre-operative diets and to establish the adequate level of weight loss as proxy for liver shrinkage prior to bariatric surgery.',\n",

The grades under investigation are a base grade containing V as a microalloying element, a Ti + grade containing Ti as microalloying element added into the base grade, and a Ti + Mn + grade containing additional Mn added into the Ti + grade. The cold-rolled steels are sub-critically annealed inside a muffle furnace to simulate industrial continuous annealing parameters in order to investigate the interaction between recrystallization and precipitation across transient stages of the annealing process as a function of temperature and time. The Zener pinning of precipitates and solute drag force of Mn on the recrystallization process are calculated and compared with measured values obtained from experimental studies on the recrystallization kinetics. Results suggest that the recrystallization kinetics is fastest in the base grade. For the Ti + grade, fine (<15 nm) (Ti,V)(C/N) particles retard the recrystallization kinetics. For the Ti+ and Ti + Mn + grades, solute drag effect of Mn solute atoms for dwell time longer than 2 min at annealing temperature of 800 °C is negligible.',\n",

Semi-structured interviews were held with a member of the commercial teams of 21 clubs.\\nFindings – Clubs use their stadiums to supply a range of products and working with partners is commonplace. These products are targeted at a range of stakeholders, such as supporters, the local\\ncommunity and regionally based organisations. In addition to their own efforts, increased geographical coverage for clubs usually develops in three ways: via internal marketing by local organisations who use the facilities, agents who market the stadium for the club and the EFL who market the league/clubs holistically.\\nResearch limitations/implications – The use of a stadium allows PSTs to diversify by providing new products for new markets. In this instance it has led to the development of capabilities in areas such as conferencing, funerals and weddings.\\nOriginality/value – This is one of the first papers to examine the capabilities developed by PSTs that lie outside the staging of matches.',\n",

The aim of the current study was to examine the feasibility and impact of an intervention with the goal of addressing these issues. Method: Design: intervention with outcome measure data collection, with no control group. Forty-nine early intervention psychosis (EIP) service patients took part in an intervention: provision of a Fitbit, Fitbit software apps, sleep hygiene, and physical activity guidance, and three discussion sessions with clinicians. The sample consisted of 29 males and 20 females, with age range of17 - 54 years, and average age of 29.5 years. Measures used were Fitbit activity and sleep data, and self-rated Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale(WEMWBS) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Results: WEMWBS scores significantly improved, with a medium effect size. PANAS negative affect (NA) dropped significantly. Analysis of Fitbit activity and sleep data yielded non-significant results. Conclusion: The intervention was acceptable to EIP patients and is feasible. Improvements in mental wellbeing and negative affect indicate the positive impact of the intervention on mental health. EIP services should consider assessing sleep quality and physical activity/exercise levels, and using this study’s intervention to promote wellbeing and mental health within recovery focused practice. Further research could be undertaken through a sufficiently powered randomised control trial (RCT)comparing this intervention and treatment as usual (TAU).',\n",

Listening to the testimonies of those who go back to the countryside, or those returning to the sea (with examples in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Iceland), one hears a mix of struggle and hope, loneliness and fear, success and fulfilment. A destiny not always chosen, an imposed tabula rasa. These movements usually go unnoticed, but some governments provide the means to facilitate them, understanding the potential they hold for the country’s wealth. A few examples are chosen here to inspire policymakers and provide insights into how to revive national economies, particularly in times of financial and economic hardship. These examples also lead us to reconsider our perspectives on the gap between the rural and the urban, and invite us to see what we may consider as a continuum of mutually reinforcing synergies.',\n",

Many people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) experience anxiety and depression. The symptoms of COPD often lead to social isolation which compounds these problems and inhibits engagement with pulmonary rehabilitation and self-management programmes. Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) seeks to improve health and well-being by building on community resources and individual strengths. An ‘open-space’ event involving people with COPD, carers, voluntary organisations and the NHS led to the creation of an innovative hybrid community clinic/peer-support group.\\nObjective: This study aims to evaluate this ABCD approach in improving the emotional well-being of people with COPD living in a Marmot city.\\nMethods: This is a prospective observational study of a piloted ABCD approach, funded by The Health Foundation. Levels of positive mental health and well-being were measured by the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) at entry to the project (T1) and after 3 months involvement with the project (T2). WEMWBS scores range from 14 to 70. Baseline MRC breathlessness scores and socio-demographic data were also recorded. Mean differences in T1 and T2 WEMWBS scores were compared using a paired Student’s t-test.\\nResults: 33 participants consented to the evaluation. All participants attended at least one session of the RIPPLE clinic. Participants were (mean (SD)) 69.19 (8.43) years old and the median MRC scale score (IQR) was 4(1). The mean (SD) baseline WEMWBS score for all participants (n=33) was 40.97 (13.83). Paired T1 and T2 WEMWBS data was available from 20 participants. The mean (SD) T1 WEMWBS score was 38.90 (14.06) and this increased to 44.70 (8.49) at T2 (p=0.030).\\nConclusions: Baseline WEMWBS scores were lower than in comparable long-term conditions. This highlights the importance of psychosocial factors in COPD. Statistically significant improvements were observed in levels of positive mental health and well-being in participants involved in the RIPPLE project at the 3 month time-point. This pilot study has shown encouraging results which need to be verified in larger studies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Proponents of large-scale land investments (LSLI) still promote them as a development opportunity, which can lead, among other benefits, to job creation and enhanced food security for local communities. However, there is increasing evidence that these investments often deprive affected communities of their access to land, with multiple negative impacts on livelihoods, food security and on the environment. This paper relies on empirical data to present an analysis of LSLI and food (in)security – crucially at the level of individuals in two villages in the Ruvuma region, Tanzania, over 10 years after the acquisition of village land within the Southern African Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). We introduce an innovative framework that permits an integration of a rights-based approach with the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to explore smallholders’ livelihoods and experiences of food insecurity. Our paper demonstrates how this integration, along with attention we have given to the FAO’s PANTHER principles, adds the missing yet crucial dimension of accountability on the part of national governments as duty bearers. Our findings show that in the case of these two villages, the human rights principles of participation, accountability, transparency and empowerment are severely undermined, with women bearing the brunt in all these domains. This overall state of affairs is, we argue, due to inadequate monitoring and evaluation of LSLI processes themselves and low levels of commitment on the part of institutions in Tanzania to monitor the promises made by investors. This in turn demonstrates an accountability deficit on the part of duty-bearers within LSLIs, and limited capacity of affected community members to claim their rights. Individual food insecurity experience in the two communities correlates, among other characteristics, with lack of land ownership, employment and income-generating activities. The rights-based livelihoods framework applied in this study points to serious deficiencies in the LSLI model as presently endorsed in SAGCOT, and emphasises the fact that access to land in Tanzania is a precondition for the realisation of the right to adequate food and thus a critical requirement for achieving and maintaining food and nutrition security. We conclude by arguing that progressive coalitions within and beyond national states must devise policies and institutions that empower individuals and civil society actors to make demands on their governments to respect, protect and fulfil their obligations regarding the legally enforceable right to food.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Professional dancers appear to be the embodied records of works of choreography that have been created, rehearsed and performed. Their precision in recalling extended sequences of movement developed for these works defies the conventional methods used to investigate memory. A distributed cognition view holds that memory will not only be individualistic, but also extended across a dance ensemble. Working closely with the highly skilled dancers of Australian Dance Theatre (ADT), we set out to develop an ecologically valid method that elicited memory recall and lapsing. Dancers were divided into two “teams” with each team asked to choose excerpts for memory recall from the company's extensive repertoire that would challenge individual dancers in the other team. There were 14 trials; 12 involved the dancers recalling dance excerpts on their own (solo condition) and 2 with a partner (duet condition). In the ADT studio, seven dancers recalled (reproduced) as much of the excerpt as possible in the absence of an accompanying soundscape. Recall was extensive, but contained lapses, and these recall failures form the core of the analysis in this study. Four novel types of memory recall were identified: static shapes, isolated movements, partial and full movement sequences; and two strategies for recall: looking for movement by moving and collaborative sketching. Four types of errors were observed: errors of detail, order, omission, and additions. Analysis was conducted through a new method of counting ‘choreographic items’. The most detailed recall (73–96%) was for the two duet excerpts with significantly poorer recall of excerpts from complex group sections of a dance. Movement gist was generally retained. The types of recall and types of errors observed pointed to the use of not only procedural memory and chaining but also contextual cues as aids to movement recall. Collaborative elements of recall were observed that suggest the importance of distributed cognition and collective memory within a contemporary dance ensemble.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Humans can synchronize movements with auditory beats or rhythms without apparent effort. This ability to entrain to the beat is considered automatic, such that any perturbations are corrected for, even if the perturbation was not consciously noted. Temporal correction of upper limb (e.g., finger tapping) and lower limb (e.g., stepping) movements to a phase perturbed auditory beat usually results in individuals being back in phase after just a few beats. When a metronome is presented in more than one sensory modality, a multisensory advantage is observed, with reduced temporal variability in finger tapping movements compared to unimodal conditions. Here, we investigate synchronization of lower limb movements (stepping in place) to auditory, visual and combined auditory-visual (AV) metronome cues. In addition, we compare movement corrections to phase advance and phase delay perturbations in the metronome for the three sensory modality conditions.We hypothesized that, as with upper limb movements, there would be a multisensory advantage, with stepping variability being lowest in the bimodal condition. As such, we further expected correction to the phase perturbation to be quickest in the bimodal condition. Our results revealed lower variability in the asynchronies between foot strikes and the metronome beats in the bimodal condition, compared to unimodal conditions. However, while participants corrected substantially quicker to perturbations in auditory compared to visual metronomes, there was no multisensory advantage in the phase correction task—correction under the bimodal condition was almost identical to the auditory-only (AO) condition. On the whole, we noted that corrections in the stepping task were smaller than those previously reported for finger tapping studies. We conclude that temporal corrections are not only affected by the reliability of the sensory information, but also the complexity of the movement itself.',\n",

(1999) suggest transitions are frequent in technical scientific writing, while Hyland (2005) suggests they are more frequent in the discursive writing of the soft disciplines. Our study contributes to both these areas with evidence from a contrastive analysis of transition use by Chinese and English writers in the Han CH-EN corpus, a closely matched corpus of successful university student writing in English. A frequency comparison of transition use by Chinese and English writers finds no significant difference for most transitions. The transition used most often by both groups is however, which is examined across contexts. English writers use however significantly more than Chinese writers, but only in a small number of disciplines, genres and sentence positions. An examination of the literacy practices in these contexts suggests that terms such as ‘overuse’ and ‘underuse’ with their negative connotations should only be used when frequency data is combined with investigations of appropriate use in context.',\n",

In this study, a novel computational framework called LncRNA identification and function prediction tool (LIFT) has been developed, which implements least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) optimisation and iterative random forests classification for selection of optimal features, a novel position-based classification (PBC) method for sub-classifying lncRNAs into different classes, and a Bayesian-based function prediction approach for annotating lncRNA transcripts. Using LASSO, LIFT selected 31 optimal features and achieved a 15-30% improvement in the prediction accuracy on plant species when evaluated against state-of-the-art CPC tools. Using PBC, LIFT successfully identified the intergenic and antisense transcripts with greater accuracy in the A. thaliana and Z. mays datasets.',\n",

Aim: to investigate which NMP roles exist within the UK, mapping distribution, and explore factors influencing their development and recruitment. Methods: two descriptive, exploratory, online self-completed semi-structured questionnaires were used. One was sent to all NHS acute healthcare providers (n=156) and private/independent healthcare providers in England (n=90). A separate questionnaire collected data, using convenience and snowballing approaches, from NMPs across the UK. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and frequency statistics. Qualitative data derived from open questions and comments were analysed using content and thematic analysis. Results: healthcare organisations in England returned 23/246 useable questionnaires; 115 NMPs returned responses, 19 did not meet the criteria, leaving 96 useable responses. Conclusion: seven NMP roles were identified, throughout the UK, with regional variation. Several factors influence the development and recruitment of NMP roles in England such as service delivery and national policies. Inconsistencies were noted in Agenda for Change pay banding. Many practitioners undertook NMP roles to progress their career clinically.',\n",

The survey findings show that the three components of brand attachment - passion, prominence, and anxiety - are positively related to impulsive and obsessive–compulsive buying. In turn, consumers who exhibit obsessive–compulsive buying are more likely to practice trash talking. Furthermore, consumer age moderates the relationship between brand passion, brand anxiety and compulsive buying. The research adds to the body of knowledge of consumer-brand relationship, particularly on the dark side of brand attachment.

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Multi-component lifestyle interventions are the first line treatment for obesity. Dietitians are ideally placed healthcare professionals to deliver such interventions. However, only a small proportion of patients with obesity are referred by general practice to dietitians, and the reasons for this are not clear. The present study aimed to explore general practice healthcare professionals’ (GPHCPs) experiences and perceptions of dietitians in the context of obesity management. Methods: A convenience sample of GPHCPs practicing in the UK was recruited via a targeted social media strategy, using virtual snowball sampling. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using framework analysis. Results: In total, 20 participants were interviewed (11 general practice nurses and nine general practitioners). Experiences of referring patients with obesity for dietetic intervention resulted in two main themes: (i) access barriers and (ii) the dietetic consult experience. Three themes emerged from participants’ perceptions of a role for general practice dietitians: (i) utilising dietetic expertise; (ii) access to dietitian; and (iii) time. Participants experienced barriers to accessing dietitians for obesity management and felt that having a dietitian working within their general practice team would help address this. Having a dietitian embedded within their general practice team was perceived to have the potential to alleviate GPHCPs’ clinical time pressures, offer opportunities for upskilling, and may improve patient engagement with obesity management. Conclusions: GPHCPs perceived that embedding a dietitian within their general practice team would be valuable and beneficial for obesity management. Our findings provide support for the funding of general practice dietitian roles in the UK.',\n",

Either the joint torque norm is minimized over two successive discrete-time samples using a short preview window, or we minimize the norm of the difference with respect to a desired momentum-damping joint torque, or the two schemes are combined together. The resulting local control methods are all formulated as well-posed linear-quadratic problems, and their closed-form solutions generate also low joint velocities while addressing the primary torque optimization objectives. Stable and consistent behaviors are obtained along short or long Cartesian position trajectories, as illustrated with simulations on a 3R planar arm and with experiments on a 7R KUKA LWR robot.',\n",

In this study we evaluated the effect of crystallographic orientation of α and α lath width around gas pore defects on the high cycle fatigue life of Wire + Arc Additive Manufactured Ti-6Al-4V by means of Electron Back Scattered Diffraction. Here we show that variations in crystallographic orientation of α lath and its width in the vicinity of the crack initiating defect were the main reasons for the considerable scatter in fatigue life. Pyramidal slip systems with high Schmid factor active around the defects resulted in longer fatigue life compared to pyramidal slip with lower Schmid factor. In the absence of pyramidal slip, cracks initiated from active prismatic slip systems. When considering the influence of the microstructure, a higher number of smaller α laths around the defect resulted in longer fatigue life, and vice versa. Overall, the fatigue crack initiation stage was controlled collectively by the complex interaction of porosity characteristics, α lath width and its crystallographic orientation at the crack initiation location.',\n",

Stepping in place incorporates aspects of gait and may be a useful tool for locomotor training. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the use of a single-tone and dual-tone metronome to cue stepping in place after hemiparetic stroke. Eight participants completed an uncued baseline stepping condition and two cued stepping conditions utilising a single-tone and a dual-tone metronome. Step times were determined from force plate data, and asymmetry and variability were calculated for the three conditions. Step time asymmetry was significantly reduced in the single-tone condition compared to baseline, and paretic step time variability was significantly reduced in both cued conditions. The single-tone metronome appeared to be preferred to the dual-tone metronome based on participant feedback. The results of this pilot study suggest that metronome cueing produces similar benefits on stepping in place to previously reported findings in walking. Further research on whether stepping in place to a metronome can be used for locomotor training is needed.',\n",

At the centre of our argument lies a contention that multiple rifts (e.g. between humans and nature, urban and rural, food and medicine) have been radically accelerated by industrial capitalism and the technocratic responses it produces, and that such rifts are the root causes of these crises. Fundamentally extractive in their commodification of labour, nature and knowledge, current food systems have cemented these deep metabolic, epistemic and social rifts, the roots of which reach back to at least the invention of the plough. The implications continue to shape health outcomes today. We argue that medicinal agroecology, existing in diverse forms but united by an understanding of food and nutrition as medicine, heals the rifts that separate us from the natural world and each other. Medicinal agroecology, as we conceive it, offers a pathway to planetary health by directly addressing the root causes of these crises rather than their symptoms, and thus constitutes a planetary medicine.',\n",

Based upon 12 semi-structured interviews conducted with Christian leaders in nine cities, the research identifies the ways in which the COVID-19 outbreak is shaping the dynamics of intra-group and inter-group connectedness within and beyond the Chinese church in Britain. It finds that COVID-19 is playing a significant role in social connectedness. This manifests in three ways: the re-configuration of a sense of belonging at church, the perception of outreach and evangelism, and the relationship between Chinese Christians from different regional backgrounds. These findings outline that the COVID-19 pandemic is triggering both cohesion and division. On one hand, the outbreak is functioning as an incubator for a stronger sense of belonging to the church and appears to encourage the church to reach out to seekers and the wider community. On the other hand, the pandemic is also dividing the Chinese church through conflicts in political views and social attitudes. Such conflicts, which are primarily about democratic values and views of China’s communist regime, are particularly observable between Mandarin-speaking Christians from mainland Chinese backgrounds and Cantonese-speaking Christians from Hong Kong backgrounds. The article argues that the coronavirus pandemic has initiated deeper reconstruction and reform in the Chinese Christian community in Britain in terms of organization and mission.',\n",

We report the findings of 2 large‐scale surveys, undertaken by the UK RCD Support Group Unique, of these families' experiences over a 10‐year period. Seven stages of the patient journey were examined. From pre‐testing, through diagnosis, genetics consultation, clinical follow‐up and peer support. Overall, 1158 families replied; 36.4% response rate (2003) and 53.6% (2013). Analysis of responses identifies significant differences (P < .001) over time with a decrease in results reported face to face (76%‐62%), doubling by telephone (12%‐22%), improved explanation of chromosome disorder (57%‐75%), and increased signposting to peer support group (34%‐62%). However, conduct of the consultation raises a number of important questions. Overall, 28 aspects of the patient journey are recognised as requiring improvement; only 12/28 are currently incorporated in UK service specifications. Involvement of RCD families has identified key service improvements. This approach can empower those affected by such extremely rare disorders, and also enable professionals to design improved services in partnership with “expert families.” Further surveys are planned.\",\n",

Our major contribution in this paper is that we first demonstrate theoretically the conditions under which hedging can increase or decrease firm value. Our theoretic model demonstrates that the ambiguous relationship between hedging and firm value may be due to a subtle combination of economic (managerial self-interest, agency problems/moral hazard, managerial ability, managerial risk aversion) and behavioural factors (overconfidence). Our empirical analysis confirms the ambiguous effect of hedging on firm performance. Empirically, we focus on the use of derivatives in the corporate hedging of three types of financial risk (foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks), and examine the effect on value and performance of listed UK corporations during 2005-2017. We demonstrate that the positive or negative effects of the hedging strategies varies significantly across both the financial risk that is hedged and the type of derivatives contracts used in the hedging as well as the time period in consideration.',\n",

The article provides insight into the complex dynamic between the lived experience of Muslim women in Dutch and Flemish societies, the shifting forms of their collective identities, and their efforts to bring about social change. We discuss the early organizational activities of migrant women from predominantly Muslim countries during the first few decades after their arrival. We explain the emergence of Islamic organizations and the growing participation of women in these organizations. We also explore the attempts made by Muslim women for feminist mobilization across ethnic and religious boundaries. Finally, we examine Muslim women’s engagement in (mixed-gender) anti-racist and LGBTQ movements. Our results indicate a rising visibility of Muslim women’s activism in the public sphere, and an increase in transversal mobilizations across ethnic and religious boundaries.

However, it is not clear whether delivery in a group or one-to-one format influences weight loss efficacy. The present study aimed to systematically review the evidence of the effectiveness of group compared to one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight management.\\nMETHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and ISRCTN databases were searched from inception up to February 2020 for randomised controlled trials comparing group versus one-to-one multi-component lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg m-2 . The primary outcome was weight loss (kg) at 12 months and the secondary outcome was attainment of ≥5% weight loss at 12 months. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Meta-analysis used random effects and estimated risk ratios and continuous inverse variance methods. Heterogeneity was investigated using I2 statistics and sensitivity analyses.\\nRESULTS: Seven randomised controlled trials with 2576 participants were included. Group interventions were favoured over one-to-one interventions for weight loss at 12 months (-1.9 kg, 95% confidence interval = -1.3 to -2.6; I2 = 99%). Participants of group interventions were more likely to attain ≥5% weight loss at 12 months relative to one-to-one interventions (relative risk = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.00; I2 = 60%).\\nCONCLUSIONS: Group multi-component lifestyle interventions are superior for weight loss compared to one-to-one interventions with respect to adult weight management. Further research is required to determine whether specific components of group interventions can explain the superiority of weight loss outcomes in group interventions.',\n",

Design An in-depth qualitative interview study with a sample of parents of children with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions who had died in PICU within the previous 12 months. A thematic analysis was conducted on the interview transcripts. Setting A PICU in a large National Health Service (NHS) tertiary children's hospital in the West Midlands, UK. Participants 17 parents of 11 children who had died in the PICU. Results Five interconnected themes were identified related to end of life care decision-making:(1) parents have significant knowledge and experiences that influence the decision-making process.(2) Trusted relationships with healthcare professionals are key to supporting parents making end of life decisions.(3) Verbal and non-verbal communication with healthcare professionals impacts on the family experience.(4) Engaging with end of life care decision-making can be emotionally overwhelming, but becomes possible if parents reach a place of acceptance'.(5) Families perceive benefits to receiving end of life care for their child in a PICU. Conclusions and implications The death of a child is an intensely emotional experience for all involved. This study adds to the limited evidence base related to parental experiences of end of life care decision-making and provides findings that have international relevance, particularly related to place of care and introduction of end of life care discussions. The expertise and previous experience of parents is highly relevant and should be acknowledged. End of life care decision-making is a complex and nuanced process; the information needs and preferences of each family are individual and need to be understood by the professionals involved in their care.\",\n",

The data are drawn from a cross-denominational survey of 438 churchgoers in rural north-west England. The majority of the survey respondents were female and aged over 60, providing important evidence of domestic abuse victimisation among this seldom-heard group. Using a broad measure of domestic abuse encompassing physical, emotional, sexual, financial and spiritual dimensions, the results revealed that one in four had experienced at least one abusive behaviour in their current intimate relationship. While headline figures for prevalence are similar for women and men, analysis revealed gender differences in four areas: number of abusive behaviours experienced, types of abuse, frequency of victimisation and impacts of abuse, with women experiencing the most frequent and high-impact abuse. Churchgoers’ comments on the church’s response to abuse reveals silence as a key theme, and the article attributes the church’s silence to gendered power relations in the wider church.',\n",

The model is validated against the case of austenite to ferrite transformation involving interphase precipitation in a V, Mn, Si alloyed HSLA steel where, λ is assumed to be equal to the inter-sheet spacing of interphase carbide precipitates. The presented model provides a computationally efficient and versatile method for predicting the ledge height, λ, and the growth kinetics of ferrite from initial nucleation through to final soft impingement considering the evolution of solute drag at growth ledge risers.

In this framework, multiple sub-optimal solutions can be found, depending on how redundancy is locally resolved in the joint space within the first step. We propose a solution method that works at the acceleration level, by using weighted pseudoinversion, optimizing an inertia-related criterion, and including null-space damping. Several numerical results obtained on different robot systems demonstrate consistently good behaviors and definitely faster motion times in comparison with related methods proposed in the literature. The motion time obtained with our method is reasonably close to the global time-optimal solution along same Cartesian path.

The struggle for access to useful plants for agriculture and food originating from other places has been one of mankind’s main motivations to travel since early times and has not only frequently led to encounters and alliances but also to conflicts and war between different cultures (Esquinas-Alcázar, 2005; Harlan, 1992; Parry, 1978; Vasey, 1992; Zohari, 2000). The history of the Treaty reflects these efforts to access and control genetic resources as well as concern for the future of mankind. The Treaty is a result of a long historical negotiation process that underwent technical, financial, political, institutional and economic phases (Cooper, 2002, 2; Kate and Lasen, 1997, 284–86; Mekour, 2002, 3–5; Rose, 2003). This chapter will illustrate the most salient features of this long process.',\n",

We examined participants’ pathways to receiving ketamine infusion to treat their depression, and their responses to, lived experiences of, and attitudes towards ketamine treatment.\\n\\nMethods\\nQualitative methods were used to conduct in-depth interviews with 13 patients (6 male; 7 female) diagnosed with treatment resistant depression (TRD) with experience of receiving ketamine treatment for depression. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was employed.\\n\\nResults\\nFor the majority of participants ketamine infusion causes a reported initial ‘high’, enhanced perception, and dissociative experience; followed by a lifting of mood and a reduction in or removal of suicidal ideation and depression symptoms lasting around 3–6 days. This leads to a reported increase in motivation, socialisation, and activity. All participants valued the therapeutic alliance with clinicians which enhanced the treatment experience and all advocated treatment access for those with depression who have not responded to other treatments.\\n\\nLimitations\\nSmall numbers, purposive sample, participant self-selection, and single site recruitment limit generalisability.\\n\\nConclusions\\nKetamine for depression can have many beneficial effects, and it is potentially life-transforming for some. Ketamine may be a source of hope for patients for whom other treatments have not been effective. For some, ketamine is not tolerated or does not have anti-depressive effects. Further qualitative in-depth exploration of patient experience and consideration of how ketamine depression treatment access can be appropriately made available are warranted.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the turn of the century, FIFA has undergone a period of intense scrutiny with accusations of bribery and corruption, accentuated by the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. This ultimately resulted in 14 FIFA members being arrested, and president Sepp Blatter banned from football. Following this, FIFA underwent a number of reforms, resulting in a new era: FIFA 2.0 However, this reform is not without issue, most notably confusion regarding the message that FIFA is transmitting. This has caused further problems; over 75% of FIFA’s income comes from the hosting of the World Cup. With the 2018 and 2022 World Cups being hosted in Russia and Qatar, external organisations are seemingly less willing to work with FIFA. A number of sponsors did not renew their contracts following the 2014 World Cup, and FIFA has struggled to replace them. Indeed, FIFA’s income has halved in the past six years. This fall in revenue causes problems for FIFA’s new vision, which includes the promise to ‘bring the game to all’. A large part of FIFA’s expenses are football development, including the newly developed FIFA Forward programme, which aims to support football in every nation across the world.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Strand: Assessment\\nProposal category: Expansion study\\n\\n\\nAttainment disparity between Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and White students is an ongoing concern within the higher education (HE) sector, and more widely within society. Recent investigation of student degree outcomes in the UK indicates that this disparity, whereby White students are awarded higher degree qualifications than BAME students, at its starkest sits at around 20% nationwide (OfS 2018). This gap in academic outcomes increases during the HE journey of these particular student populations, despite sector-wide recognition of systemic inequality (UUK and NUS 2019).\\n\\nOur work therefore seeks to better understand institutional practices and policies that may contribute to this ethnic attainment disparity. We specifically attempt to unpick the ways in which the ‘written feedback information’ (Boud 2013) that students receive may be connected to their degree award outcomes. This focus has two main drivers: 1. written feedback information given to assessed work is one of the main channels through which lecturers engage formally with individual students, throughout students’ HE journey, and 2. students at local and national levels have voiced ongoing dissatisfaction with feedback and assessment practices, disproportionate to other satisfaction indicators (e.g. National Student Survey results (OfS 2019)).\\n\\nWe previously looked at whether differences in the nature of written feedback information can be differentiated according to the variable of discipline, for which we developed a framework of feedback functions (Alsop and Gardner 2019). This framework is comprised of five main functions (‘advice’, ‘critique’, ‘observation’, ‘praise’, ‘query’) and a catchall ‘unclassified’ option. Each function is subdivided three times, firstly by focus (e.g. ‘advice’ splits into ‘suggestion’ and ‘instruction’), then by orientation (‘specific’ or ‘general’), and then by aspect (‘future’ or ‘present’). We found that it was possible to differentiate the nature of the written feedback information received by individual students based on the variable of discipline.\\n\\nIn this paper, we explore further whether we can use this framework as a starting point to investigate whether a relationship exists between students’ ethnicity and language patterns within the written feedback information they receive. To do so, we applied our framework to 50 texts written to students from different ethnic backgrounds within a single discipline in a post-92 HE institution in the UK. Each file in the small corpus includes the feedback text written by the instructor to the student, and also metadata information about that student. Metadata variables include socioeconomic information (such as ‘ethnicity’, ‘gender’, and ‘home postcode’) and academic information (such as ‘assignment grade’, ‘discipline’, and ‘level of study’). The variable of ethnicity is self-identified when students apply to HE institutions in the UK (see HESA 2018). After manually encoding all texts, using individual comments as the unit of analysis, we looked at the relationship between students’ ethnicity, grade attained, and the language of the written feedback that they receive.\\n\\nWe will discuss findings from the analysis of this small dataset. Preliminary results indicate that little differentiation is evident in terms of the categorisation of written feedback information at the highest level of overall function in relation to binary categories of self-identified ethnicity (BAME and White). A more granular investigation of feedback function at the level of focus and orientation indicates some differentiation in the language of the feedback written to White and BAME student populations. Further differentiation is evident in the language of written feedback information at the level of overall function between the distinct ethnic populations that comprise the broad BAME category. Overall, there is greater differentiation in the language of written feedback information at the level of particular functions within BAME populations than between White and BAME populations.\\n\\nAs part of a wider research project, what this stage of analysis confirms is the importance of granularity when investigating institutional practices and student academic outcomes. In the context of the ethnic attainment gap, we do not propose a direct causal relationship between the language of written feedback information and student ethnicity, but rather suggest that written feedback information may constitute one means by which certain (already disadvantaged) groups of students are further, and cumulatively, disengaged by higher education practices.\\n\\nAnalysis also resulted in minor amendments to the 2019 working feedback framework; we added ‘neutral’ as a branch of the aspect attribute, alongside ‘present’ and ‘future’. This amendment is intended to capture more finely lecturer intention so that we can later compare this to student perceptions, which we anticipate will be a productive gap to explore.\\n\\nThis small study gives us confidence to progress to the next stage in our broader research project, which is to extend both the scale of the corpus and also the method of analysis to include investigation of the intersection of impacting variables.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nBoud, D.

Empirical evidence documented here shows that dispersion in system losses and revenue losses is high across network operators, although it is not possible to disentangle managerial inefficiency from exogenous technical losses in the distribution systems. Asymmetric information on the part of the regulator and the state ownership of electricity networks is delaying any incentive base tariff regulation regime for the distribution firms. It is important that in the early stage of regulation, standards in cost-based reporting are set and benchmarks are established in order to perform cost-based regulation effectively. As only the availability of reliable information about current and potential future cost can help to rationalize tariffs and generate resources for the long run investment required for the stable electricity supply in the country.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity. However, without recommended follow-up it has long-term risks. Aim To investigate whether nutritional and weight monitoring in primary care meets current clinical guidance, after patients are discharged from specialist bariatric care. Design and setting Retrospective cohort study in primary care practices contributing to IQVIA Medical Research Data in the UK (1 January 2000 to 17 January 2018). Method Participants were adults who had had bariatric surgery with a minimum of 3 years’ follow-up post-surgery, as this study focused on patients discharged from specialist care (at 2 years post-surgery). Outcomes were the annual proportion of patients from 2 years post-surgery with a record of recommended nutritional screening blood tests, weight measurement, and prescription of nutritional supplements, and the proportions with nutritional deficiencies based on blood tests. Results A total of 3137 participants were included in the study, and median follow-up post-surgery was 5.7 (4.2–7.6) years. Between 45% and 59% of these patients had an annual weight measurement. The greatest proportions of patients with a record of annual nutritional blood tests were for tests routinely conducted in primary care, for example, recorded haemoglobin measurement varied between 44.9% (n = 629/1400) and 61.2% (n = 653/1067). Annual proportions of blood tests specific to bariatric surgery were low, for example, recorded copper measurement varied between 1.2% (n = 10/818) and 1.5% (n = 16/1067) where recommended. Results indicated that the most common deficiency was anaemia. Annual proportions of patients with prescriptions for recommended nutritional supplements were low. Conclusion This study suggests that patients who have bariatric surgery are not receiving the recommended nutritional monitoring after discharge from specialist care. GPs and patients should be supported to engage with follow-up care. Future research should aim to understand the reasons underpinning these findings.',\n",

The model conserves homogeneity of stress in the diffuse interface between elastically inhomogeneous phases and provides an explanation of the mechanism resulting in the pairing of two adjacent interphase precipitates. Several scenarios of inhomogeneous elastic conditions have been considered. The simulations for a situation where only the interfacial energy is considered to contribute to the transformation show that this energy can lead to the establishment of a neck between two neighbouring precipitates. However, if sufficient time is given, one of the precipitates will completely dissolve into its neighbouring particle. On the other hand, when both strain and interfacial energies act on the system, the bridge between the particles becomes stabilised leading to the pairing of the particles. This is a result of the particles tendency to minimise the strain energy due to the excessive strain field generated by the neck between the two particles.',\n",

In post-apartheid South Africa, this is deeply problematic.

Theorising the connections among religion, storytelling, identity, subject-formation, and conversion, the chapter conceptualises conversion stories as enabling individual subjects to negotiate a terrain of difference and transformation, including multiple dimensions of belonging. On the basis of a critical operationalisation of Wohlrab-Sahr’s (1999) analytical concepts of ‘syncretism’ and ‘symbolic battle’, the analysis focuses on four memoirs written by women who turn to Judaism and Islam, and looks at motivations for conversion, and understandings of the past and present and different selves. The case studies show that the memoirs construct lifeworlds and selves on a continuum of syncretic and symbolic battle scripts. They moreover demonstrate that converts’ experiences need to be situated within the respective religious traditions, as well as within larger discourses about Judaism and Islam in Western Europe. As such, the chapter contributes empirical insights into experiences of religious, social, and gendered trajectories of conversion/transformation. Moreover, it connects empirical converts’ experiences of becoming Jewish or Muslim to theorising the positions of Judaism and Islam as minoritised traditions and communities in Western Europe.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: The prevalence of nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and requirement for liver transplantation. There is uncertainty surrounding the relative benefits and harms of various lifestyle interventions for people with NAFLD. Objectives: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different lifestyle interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of the different lifestyle interventions according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD. Selection criteria: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with NAFLD, whatever the method of diagnosis, age, and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis: We planned to perform a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and to calculate the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios (RaRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-participant analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. However, the data were too sparse for the clinical outcomes. We therefore performed only direct comparisons (head-to-head comparisons) with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods. Main results: We included a total of 59 randomised clinical trials (3631 participants) in the review. All but two trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 33 different interventions, ranging from advice to supervised exercise and special diets, or a combination of these and no additional intervention were compared in these trials. The reference treatment was no active intervention. Twenty-eight trials (1942 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 24 months. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The follow-up period in the trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 24 months. During this short follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. This is probably because of the very short follow-up periods. It takes a follow-up of 8 years to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. It is therefore unlikely that differences by clinical outcomes will be noted in trials with less than 5 years to 10 years of follow-up. In one trial, one participant developed an adverse event. There were no adverse events in any of the remaining participants in this trial, or in any of the remaining trials, which seemed to be directly related to the intervention. Authors' conclusions: The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the lifestyle interventions compared with no additional intervention (to general public health advice) on any of the clinical outcomes after a short follow-up period of 2 months to 24 months in people with nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (a study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of participants to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice), comparing aerobic exercise and dietary advice versus standard of care (exercise and dietary advice received as part of national health promotion). The reason for the choice of aerobic exercise and dietary advice is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes which may translate to clinical benefit. The outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource use measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare use after a minimum follow-up of eight years, to find meaningful differences in the clinically important outcomes.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objective: Antibiotic resistance is a common complication in long-term urinary tract infections (UTIs). Alternative treatments, such as UroShield acoustic wave technology prevents bacteria from attaching to the surface of catheters and has reduced the number of treated UTIs. The objective of the study was to compare quantitative and qualitative outcomes in patients with long-term UTIs at the start of UroShield treatment and after a 12-week trial. Methods: 23 patients with reoccurring UTIs were offered to use UroShield for a period of 12 weeks. Objective and subjective measures of improvement were recorded every week, including the number of UTIs, antibiotic treatment, catheter blockage and changes, bladder washout, hospitalisations or nurse visits due to UTIs, level of pain, sleep, and mobility. The patients’ qualitative reports about the device were recorded. The ongoing study started in 2018. Results: Wilcoxon signed ranks non-parametric test and thematic analysis were used to detect changes in UTIs and selfreported measures of pain and ease of wear. Patients reported a significant decrease in the number of UTIs and antibiotic treatment after a 12-week use of the Uroshield device (p < .001 and p = .009, respectively). Similarly, they had fewer catheter blockages and catheter changes (p = .006 and p < .001, respectively). Bladder washouts did not decrease over time. The pain was mild to moderate at the start of the trial which reduced significantly by the end of the trial (p = .017). Qualitative analysis confirmed the impact of the device on patients’ well-being, but an expanded study is needed to confirm these results. Further improvements to the device hardware have been identified by the patients. Conclusions: UroShield reduced the number of UTIs, catheter blockages and changes, and consequently the need for antibiotics. Patients reported the device is easy to use, were related to little to no pain, and overall improved patients’ well-being and mobility. We suggest the device should be considered as an appropriate treatment in long-term persistent UTIs.',\n",

With funding from the Australian Research Council, the project brought together scientific researchers with artists from the Australian Dance Theatre with the broad aim of investigating “the nature of thinking in dance by investigating creative processes, memory, and expertise” (Stevens, et al). As a part of this project, in-depth interviews were used to develop a set of protocol for documenting aspects of the company’s creative process. The chapter is divided into four parts. The first places this project into historical context with similar projects involving scientists and artists where the focus of study has been creative process in dance. The second discusses the concept of collaborative design (co-design) and the challenges of tracing and showing results that do not conform to disciplinary expectations. A third part draws examples from the original interviews to demonstrate how particular documentation protocol are developed and offers descriptions that blend models from previous projects. The final part briefly explores the idea that the results of process documentation manifest as ‘prototype exchange objects’ and ends with a call for allowing more of the unexpected to emerge from such projects.',\n",

Additionally, we examine the association between corporate ownership structure and cash dividends. Using a data set of Indonesian listed firms for the period from 1995 to 2014, we find that excessive cash holding (overinvestment) positively (negatively) affects a firm’s likelihood of paying dividends. Also, we find that family, foreign, state and institutional ownership have significantly negative links with dividends, which suggests the signals of expropriation of firms’ wealth by major shareholders. These findings strongly support the expropriation hypothesis that commonly applies to firms with higher level of concentration or to firms in a weak legal environment by which the rights of minority interests are put at risk by large shareholders.',\n",

A transition is needed that takes into account what farming is and who the farmers are. Rather than perpetuating the idea of the poor small farmer, it is time to understand family farmers, also called peasants, for what they are: solid professionals with wide skills, rooted in time and space, with the ability to produce value at local level and wealth at global level. Viable forms of farming exist and are evolving in different parts of the world and many transitions are proving successful.

İstanbul da 1990’lı yıllardan bu yana düzenli olarak oyunlara ev sahipliği yapmak için aday olan şehirlerarasında yer almıştır. Bu araştırmanın amacı İstanbul’un 1993-2013 yılları arasında gerçekleşen Olimpiyat Oyunları adaylıkları neticesinde ortaya çıkan olumlu ve olumsuz çıktıların incelenmesi ve tanımlanmasıdır. Literatürde yer alan güncel bilimsel araştırmalar, ağırlıklı olarak, spor etkinliklerine ev sahipliği yapılması neticesinde ortaya çıkan mirasa odaklanırken, bu araştırmada adaylık neticesinde ortaya çıkan etkilere odaklanılmıştır. Son dönemde Olimpiyat Oyunları adaylığı süreci devam ederken adaylıktan çekilen şehirlerin sayısının artması ve aday olan ülke sayısının düşmesi bu araştırmayı önemli kılmaktadır. Araştırma kapsamında İstanbul’un Olimpiyat Oyunları adaylıkları sürecinde görev almış dokuz üst düzey yetkili ile yarı yapılandırılmış mülakatlar gerçekleştirilmiş, bu konuda hazırlanmış yazılı raporlar ve başvuru dokümanları incelenmiştir. Araştırmadan elde edilen bulgular, İstanbul’un Olimpiyat Oyunları adaylıkları neticesinde birçok somut ve soyut çıktının varlığına işaret etmektedir. Ancak bu çıktıların birçoğu “etki” olarak kalmış, yalnızca kısıtlı bir kısmı ise mirasa dönüşebilmiştir. Araştırma sonucunda şehrin ve ülkenin tanıtımına katkı sağlanması, ulaşım ve altyapı gelişiminin ivme kazanması, spor etkinliklerine ev sahipliği yapma kapasitesinin artması, örgütler arası iş birliklerinin oluşması, spor şebekelerinin gelişmesi gibi birtakım çıktılar tespit edilmiştir. Öte yandan, toplumda yaşanan hayal kırıklığı, halkın değerlendirme sürecine olan inancının azalması gibi olumsuz çıktılar da mevcuttur. Araştırmadan elde edilen bulguların İstanbul’un gelecekte gerçekleşmesi muhtemel yeni bir adaylık sürecine ve büyük boyutlu spor etkinliklerine aday olmayı planlayan Türk spor örgütlerinin miras planlama sürecine katkısı olacağı öngörülmektedir.',\n",

Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors. Methods: All patients enrolled on a face-to-face group WMP, which constitutes part of a Tier 3 WMP delivered by the NHS, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP. Baseline data included weight, BMI, age, gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile score. The outcomes were accept/decline transfer to the virtual group WMP. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake. Results: The 315 participants were included, of which 72.1% (n = 227) accepted. After adjusting for gender, deprivation and BMI; older patients (OR 0.966, [95% CI 0.944, 0.989]; p = 0.003) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients (OR 0.460 [95% 0.248, 0.851]; p = 0.023) were less likely to accept the virtual group WMP. Conclusion: Strategies aimed at improving uptake of group WMP among BAME and older adult groups are needed, particularly considering the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups, and the links between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes.',\n",

As a result, many small-scale food producers faced difficulties growing, harvesting, and selling their goods. This participatory research examines local small-scale farmers’ challenges as farmers but also as consumers and their coping strategies during the month of April and one week in June 2020. The study was initiated and conceptualized in collaboration with small-scale farmer members of an existing research network in selected urban and rural areas in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia. Participants co-designed the research, collected and uploaded data through digital survey tools, and contributed to data analysis and interpretation. A common observation across regions is that the measures imposed in response to COVID-19 highlighted and partly exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities among food system actors. Strict lockdowns in Cape Town, South Africa, and Masvingo, Zimbabwe, significantly restricted the production capacity of small-scale farmers in the informal economy and created more food insecurity for them. In Maputo, Mozambique, and Toraja and Java, Indonesia, local food systems continued to operate and were even strengthened by higher social capital and adaptive capacities.',\n",

There were significantly fewer falls in those who had led an active lifestyle compared to those who had not (χ2Yates=4.568, p=0.033), with a lower relative risk of fall occurrence for the active respondents (RR=0.671) compared to the inactive (RR=1.210).

       "  'abstract': 'This study estimates a cost function for fossil fuel-based electricity generating plants operating in Pakistan during 2006–11. It employs a six-year panel dataset for 31 plants to estimate the cost function parameters. In the absence of any current evidence on comparative cost performance, the study’s attempt to document the economic efficiency of power plants in a large electricity sector is an important contribution to the literature. We find that on average, private nonutility plants (IPPs) are about 17 years younger than utility-owned plants and that the average capacity utilization, as measured by load factor, is higher for private IPPs than for public plants. After controlling for observables, the results show that, for a large part of the system, private plants produce electricity at a lower unit fuel cost than utility-owned public plants. The low efficiency of public plants is likely a result of the lack of operational maintenance and routine repairs. We find that the average fuel price (PRs per MMBTU) is lower for public plants and utility-owned private plants compared to nonutility-owned private plants which is mainly due to the composition of the fuel mix used for power generation. We also find that (i) the partial effect of fuel price changes on the average unit cost is higher for private plants than for public plants and (ii) on average, private plants use relatively expensive fuels compared to public plants. On an average fuel cost comparison, the private sector plants may be better base load plants than public sector plants, though the private sector plants may not be being used as base load plants because of the higher tariffs they change.',\n",

In the case of WE43 gas bulge testing was employed at 400 °C and 0.6\\u2005MPa to offer a better analogy to superplastic forming than uniaxial tensile testing. Elongations of over 400 % were observed within WE43 when tested at 450 °C and 1⋅10‐3\\u2005s‐1 strain rate, and over 200 % within AZ91 when tested at 350 °C and 1⋅10‐3\\u2005s‐1 strain rate. A peak cone height of 41\\u2005mm was achieved with WE43 at a temperature of 400 °C and pressure of 0.6\\u2005MPa. Electron back scattered detection technique was employed to analyse the microstructural evolution of the two alloys during the forming process. Both WE43 and AZ91 were observed to undergo dynamic recrystallization during elevated temperature tensile testing and failed at low strain rates mainly by means of coalescence of cavitation, in the case of AZ91 at high strain rates cracking of Al12Mg17 intermetallic particles was the dominating failure mechanism. Both alloys were seen to achieve good levels of superplastic ductility over 200 % elongation, which would be industrially useful in niche vehicle and aerospace manufacturing.',\n",

Template analysis was employed to generate a model of shared value creation that extends prior literature. Results and findings: Findings indicate that sponsors and MSEs can utilise organisational capabilities, consistency and cultivation to create shared value. This process is boosted by a symbiotic relationship between MSEs and sponsor(s). The length of sponsorship also affects positive outcomes arising from CSV by a number of additional actors within the ecosystem, including host citizens, athletes, and consumers. Implications: This study posits a model that advances the concept of CSV and its application within the context of MSEs. It contributes to developing enduring sponsor-MSE relationships aimed at creating a lasting footprint with a range of actors within their ecosystem.

Drawing on empirical data from an innovative, cross-disciplinary, community-based participatory research project between a United Kingdom-based refugee organization and two universities, this article explores the viability, complexities and tensions inherent in making queer identities visible. While highlighting the potential of arts-based methods to explore inclusive approaches to sexuality, we discuss the limits of this work and the resistance it created.

As a part of routine clinical service, patients with TRD received right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) inhibitory rTMS immediately prior to left DLPFC depression treatment delivered according to a US Food and Drug Administration protocol.\\n\\nMethods: A retrospective investigation of routinely collected data between 2016 and 2018 was undertaken. Measures used were the clinician rated Clinical Global Impressions–Severity (CGI-S) scale and Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D), and the patient-rated Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale–7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The outcome data of 61 patients with TRD were analyzed. The sample included patients with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.\\n\\nResults: Response and remission rates, respectively, were 17.1% and 27.3% on the GAD-7; 20.7% and 12.5% on the HAM-D; 19% and 24% on the PHQ-9; and 20% and 23.5% on the CGI-S. Post-treatment scores significantly improved on the GAD-7, HAM-D, and CGI-S scales, with medium to large effect sizes (.61, .62, and .86 respectively).\\n\\nConclusions: Results indicate the potential value of rTMS in treating anxiety in patients who are referred for rTMS for TRD.

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Information and communication technologies are used increasingly to facilitate social networks and support women during the perinatal period. This paper presents data on how technology use affects the association between women's social support and, (i) mental wellbeing and, (ii) self-efficacy in the antenatal period. METHODS: Data were collected as part of an ongoing study - the BaBBLeS study - exploring the effect of a pregnancy and maternity software application (app) on maternal wellbeing and self-efficacy. Between September 2016 and February 2017, we aimed to recruit first-time pregnant women at 12-16 gestation weeks in five maternity sites across England and asked them to complete questionnaires. Outcomes included maternal mental wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), and antenatal self-efficacy (antenatal version of the Tool to Measure Parenting Self-Efficacy). Other variables assessed were perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), general technology use (adapted from Media and Technology Usage and Attitudes Scale). Potential confounders were age, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic deprivation, employment, relationship status and recruitment site. Linear regression models were developed to analyse the relationship between social support and the outcomes. RESULTS: Participants (n =\\u2009492, median age\\u2009=\\u200928 years) were predominantly white British (64.6%). Half of them had a degree or higher degree (49.3%), most were married/living with a partner (83.6%) and employed (86.2%). Median (LQ-UQ) overall scores were 81.0 (74.0-84.0) for social support (range 12-84), 5.1 (4.7-5.4) for technology use (range 1-6), 54.0 (48.0-60.0) for mental well-being (range 14-70), and 319.0 (295.5-340) for self-efficacy (range 0-360). Social support was significantly associated with antenatal mental well-being adjusting for confounders [adj R2 =\\u20090.13, p <\\u2009.001]. The addition of technology use did not alter this model [adj R2 =\\u20090.13, p <\\u2009.001]. Social support was also significantly associated with self-efficacy after adjustment [adj R2 =\\u20090.14, p <\\u2009.001]; technology had limited impact on this association [adj R2 =\\u20090.13, p <\\u2009.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Social support is associated with mental well-being and self-efficacy in antenatal first-time mothers. This association was not significantly affected by general technology use as measured in our survey. Future work should investigate whether pregnancy-specific technologies yield greater potential to enhance the perceived social support, wellbeing and self-efficacy of antenatal women.\",\n",

Between 1990 and 2000, a sizeable earnings advantage of immigrants over nonimmigrants employed in the hi-tech sector evaporated, and this change was most noticeable in the largest cities. We use population census microdata to examine the geographical dimensions of this shift. After controlling for individual characteristics, we show that immigrants in the largest and tech-intensive cities earn significantly less relative to nonimmigrants than those in midsized and smaller cities. We also present results comparing the hi-tech immigrant wage and earnings gap for the five largest Canadian cities. The findings are consistent with the notion that geographic differences are an important component of the overall earnings gap between immigrants and nonimmigrants.\",\n",

The participants judged weights using both proprioception and cutaneous cues, proprioception-only cues and cutaneous-only cues.

This review seeks to assess the current integrated clinical pathway for obesity management in England and determine the major challenges. Recent Findings Evidence for tier 2 (community-based lifestyle intervention) and tier 3 (specialist weight management services) is limited, and how it facilitates care and improve outcomes in tier 4 remains uncertain. Treatment access, rigidity in pathways, uncertain treatment outcomes and weight stigma seems to be major barriers to improved care. Summary More emphasis must be placed on access to effective treatments, treatment flexibility, addressing stigma and ensuring treatment efficacy including long-term health outcomes. Prevention and treatment should both receive significant focus though should be considered to be largely separate pathways. A simplified system for weight management is needed to allow flexibility and the delivery of personalized care including post-bariatric surgery care for those who need it.',\n",

We consider here one instance of such a visual coordination task, with the robot end-effector that should maintain a prescribed position with respect to a moving RGB-D camera while pointing at it. For the 3D localization of the moving camera, we compare three different techniques and introduce some improvements to the best solution found for our application. For the motion tracking problem, we introduce a relaxed version of the pointing part of the task. This allows to take advantage of the redundancy of the robot, distributing the control effort over the available degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by V-REP simulations and experiments with the 7-dof KUKA LWR manipulator.',\n",

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the precipitates and their size distributions in Fe-0.047C-0.2V-1.6Mn (in wt.%) alloy samples which had been austenitized, isothermally transformed at 700 °C for between 3 and 600 min and water quenched. TEM confirms that, following heat treatment, rows of vanadium-containing nanoscale interphase precipitates were present. Model-independent analysis of the nuclear SANS signal and model fitting calculations, using oblate spheroid and disc-shapes, were performed. The major axis diameter increased from 18 nm after 3 min to 35 nm after 600 min. Precipitate volume percent increased from 0.09 to 0.22 vol% over the same period and number density fell from 2 × 1021 to 5 × 1020 m−3.

       "  'abstract': 'There is currently a lack of clear guidance setting out ethical best practice in 3D forensic science broadly, and for 3D printing human remains specifically. This paper presents nine ethical principles identified by Carew et al. [4,7] that provide a foundation for establishing ethical practice. The relevance of the nine key normative ethics principles (justice transparency, proportionality, beneficence, context, non-maleficence, anonymity, consent, and autonomy) is outlined, and a hierarchical ethics framework is presented that sets out a synthesis of these nine principles at societal, case, and task levels. This framework sets out key principles to be considered at different stages in the forensic science process and in operational planning, as well as identifying the accountability of key decision makers at each stage. The hierarchical ethics framework provides an adaptive tool that forensic actors can use in practice, to take each ethical principle into consideration and develop best ethical practice, that ensures 3D printed human remains are created and used in an ethical manner.',\n",

Methods: The study was a retrospective investigation of routinely collected data on patients receiving ketamine infusion between 2017 and 2019. Measures used were the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and self-reported Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR). The outcome data of 28 patients with TRD were analysed. A minimum course of treatment was defined as three ketamine infusions. Results: Response combined with partial response, response, and remission rates respectively were 42.3%, 23.1% and 4.2% for the BDI; 18.2%, 9.1% and 0% for the QIDS-SR; 50%, 18.2% and 4.6% for the CGI. There was a statistically significant improvement on the BDI with a medium effect size (0.63). There was not a significant improvement in the CGI or QIDS-SR. Conclusions: The results show a mixed picture the impact ketamine on symptoms of depression in TRD over the course of multiple infusions. The results need to be viewed in the context of clinical outcome data collection: outcome scores are taken prior to treatment and so are at a point when ketamine is not having an active effect. The findings can inform the availability of ketamine infusion as a treatment option for TRD where treatment adhering to national guidelines has not succeeded. A qualitative investigation of the experience of people receiving ketamine would provide further insights',\n",

As investors’ decision making process largely depends on financial information and corporate reports, transparency is capital for the stability of a company, or even the stability of a country via the corporate sector. This research introduces the system reliability theory to properly model the behaviour of companies regarding their corporate governance mechanisms. We propose the assessment of the corporate governance framework by mapping its inputs as components (either in operating or failed state) along with firm characteristics to determine an approximate Structure Function that enables alternatively modeling the functioning of the system, quantifying its reliability and detecting critical components. The advantage of the proposed mapping approach is illustrated using a sample of 1109U.S. listed companies during the period 2002–2014, reporting financial and non-financial information as components of the corporate governance system and the return on assets as the system output. The proposed approach is also useful for modelling other non-engineering sub-systems; companies, financial markets or even economies would be exposed to significant risk if these systems do not function properly.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: The prevalence of non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD. Currently no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD. Objectives: • To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis • To generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD. Selection criteria: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results: We included in the review a total of 202 randomised clinical trials (14,200 participants). Nineteen trials were at low risk of bias. A total of 32 different interventions were compared in these trials. A total of 115 trials (7732 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 28 months. The follow-up period in trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 28 months. During this follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. We did not calculate effect estimates for mortality because of sparse data (zero events for at least one of the groups in the trial). None of the trials reported that they measured overall health-related quality of life using a validated scale. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions on serious adverse events (number of people or number of events). We are very uncertain about effects on adverse events of most of the supplements that we investigated, as the evidence is of very low certainty. However, people taking PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) may be more likely to experience an adverse event than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta-analysis results: OR 4.44, 95% CrI 2.40 to 8.48; low-certainty evidence; 4 trials, 203 participants; direct evidence: OR 4.43, 95% CrI 2.43 to 8.42). People who take other supplements (a category that includes nutritional supplements other than vitamins, fatty acids, phospholipids, and antioxidants) had higher numbers of adverse events than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta-analysis: rate ratio 1.73, 95% CrI 1.26 to 2.41; 6 trials, 291 participants; direct evidence: rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.25 to 2.40; low-certainty evidence). Data were sparse (zero events in all groups in the trial) for liver transplantation, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we did not perform formal analysis for these outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of other antioxidants (antioxidants other than vitamins) compared to no active intervention on liver cirrhosis (HR 1.68, 95% CrI 0.23 to 15.10; 1 trial, 99 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions in any of the remaining comparisons, or data were sparse (with zero events in at least one of the groups), precluding formal calculations of effect estimates. Data were probably because of the very short follow-up period (2 months to 28 months). It takes follow-up of 8 to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes are noted in trials providing less than 5 to 10 years of follow-up. Authors' conclusions: The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of nutritional supplementation compared to no additional intervention on all clinical outcomes for people with non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of patients to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice) comparing interventions such as vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, PUFAs, and no nutritional supplementation. The reason for the choice of interventions is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes, which may translate to clinical benefit. Outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource utilisation measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare utilisation after minimum follow-up of 8 years (to find meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes).\",\n",

This study examines the influence of actual and ideal self-congruence on brand attachment and two dimensions of compulsive buying behavior (i.e. impulsive and obsessive-compulsive buying). Based on a survey of 427 respondents, it is evident that self-congruence directly affects brand attachment, where actual self-congruence is a stronger predictor of brand attachment. Both actual and ideal self-congruence do not directly affect obsessive-compulsive buying. This indicates that brand attachment fully mediates the relationships. However, actual self-congruence directly affects impulsive buying but ideal self-congruence does not. This indicates that brand attachment partially mediates the relationship between actual self-congruence and impulsive buying and fully mediates the relationship between ideal self-congruence and impulsive buying.

Objectives: To examine the relationship between weight changes during (1) MWM, and (2) preoperative low-energy-diet (LED), and weight changes at 12 and 24 months after surgery. Setting: Multicenter community- and acute-based MWM services referring to one regional bariatric center, United Kingdom. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients who attended MWM and then underwent a primary laparoscopic bariatric procedure (adjustable gastric banding [LAGB], or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]) in a single bariatric center in the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2015. Data were collected from patient electronic records. Results: Two hundred eight patients were included (LAGB n = 128, RYGB n = 80). Anthropometric data were available for 94.7% and 88.0% of participants at 12 and 24 months, respectively. There was no relationship between weight loss during MWM and after surgery at either 12 or 24 months. Weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB (β = .251, P = .006) and less weight loss after RYGB (β = −.390, P = .003) at 24 months, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline weight, and LED duration. Conclusions: Weight loss in MWM does not predict greater weight loss outcomes up to 24 months after LAGB or RYGB. Greater weight loss during the preoperative LED predicted greater weight loss after LAGB and less weight loss after RYGB. Our results suggest that patients should not be denied bariatric surgery because of not achieving weight loss in MWM. Weight loss responses to preoperative LEDs as a predictor of postsurgical weight loss requires further investigation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Polo has an established tradition and is played in over 80 countries. No previous research has attempted to determine the physiological demands placed upon the players however. There is therefore limited evidence from which to develop strength & conditioning programmes. The aim of this study was to quantify the cardiovascular demand placed upon players during elite polo competition. Heart rate was recorded in seven professional male polo players (age 28.71±4.31 years; mass 72.13±5.46 kg; handicap 6.14±0.38 goals) during two high-goal polo matches, and was classified into heart rate zones based on ASCM guidelines. The mean heart rate for the match was 150 ± 20 beat.min−1, with the 3rd chukka producing the highest mean heart rate of the 5 played (154 ± 23 beat.min−1). The largest proportion of playing time was spent in the hard heart rate zone. The results suggest that polo evokes a high cardiovascular load and training should therefore include aerobic fitness training in addition to technical skill development. Further research is needed to advance knowledge of the physiological and biomechanical demands of this sport and employment of suitable methods of notational analysis is required to extend appreciation of the technical and tactical nature of the sport.',\n",

In this study, the mechanical properties of two duplex low-density steels, Fe-15Mn-10Al-0.8C-5Ni and Fe-15Mn-10Al-0.8C (wt.%) were investigated through nano-indentation and simulation through utilization of ab initio formalisms in Density Functional Theory (DFT) in order to establish the hardness resulting from two critical structural features (kappa-carbides and B2 intermetallic) as a function of annealing temperature (500 − 1050 ℃) and the addition of Ni. In the Ni-free sample, the calculated elastic properties of kappa-carbides were compared with those of the B2 intermetallic Fe3Al − L12, and the role of Mn in the kappa structure and its elastic properties were studied. The Ni-containing samples were found to have a higher hardness due to the B2 phase composition being NiAl rather than FeAl, with Ni-Al bonds reported to be stronger than the Fe-Al bonds. In both samples, at temperatures of 900 ℃ and above, the ferrite phase contained nano-sized discs of B2 phase, wherein the Ni-containing samples exhibited higher hardness, attributed again to the stronger Ni-Al bonds in the B2 phase. At 700 ℃ and below, the nano-sized B2 discs were replaced by micrometre sized needles of kappa in the Ni-free sample resulting in a lowering of the hardness. In the Ni-containing sample, the entire alpha phase was replaced by B2 stringers, which had a lower hardness than the Ni-Al nano-discs due to a lower Ni content in B2 stringer bands formed at 700 ℃ and below. In addition, the hardness of needle-like kappa-carbides formed in alpha phase was found to be a function of Mn content. Although it was impossible to measure the hardness of cuboid kappa particles in gamma phase because of their nano-size, the hardness value of composite phases, e.g. gamma + kappa was measured and reported. All the hardness values were compared and rationalized by bonding energy between different atoms.',\n",

However, previous work has stopped short of interrogating the underlying ethical concepts. The question of how people understand and apply these concepts in practice, and what it means to act ethically, remain underexplored. This thematic review explores the ethical considerations that contribute to the creation and use of 3D printed human remains for forensic purposes. The three main branches of ethical theory are outlined to explore how they may apply to forensic practice. Key themes relating to 3D printing human remains in forensic contexts were explored to better understand the ethics landscape, ethical challenges, and the current guidelines in place. Through this thematic review, nine ethics principles were identified as key principles for guiding best practice: anonymity, autonomy, beneficence, consent, context, justice, non-maleficence, proportionality, and transparency. It is suggested that these principles could be incorporated into adaptable guidelines going forward to support ethical practice. The findings also suggest that holistic ethics cognition training may have value in supporting forensic scientists in ethical decision-making, together with procedural and structural design that may promote best practice and reduce cognitive load.',\n",

We further evaluate the relationship between prior and subsequent CFP and prior and subsequent CSP. Based on the system-GMM estimation method, we provide direct evidence that suggests that while CFP and CSP can be linked linearly; however, when we examine the impact of CSP on CFP, the association is more non-linear (cubic) than linear. Our results suggest that firms periodically adjust their level of commitment to society, in order to meet their target CSP. The primary contributions of this paper are testing (1) the non-monotonous relationship between CSP and CFP, (2) the lagged relationship between the two and the optimality of CSP levels, and (3) the presence of a virtuous circle. Our results further suggest that CSP contributes to CFP better during post-crisis years. Our findings are robust to year-on-year changes in CFP and CSP, financial versus non-financial firms, and the intensity of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement across industries.',\n",

The article outlines the permutations of these approaches, showing their points of similarity and difference, and argues that feminism, biological essentialism and notions of reasonableness or “cultural common sense” feature in all three, being integral to the gender discourse of “post-feminist” UK society. The article argues that religion functions as a resource in Christian students’ gender attitudes, alongside other resources such as friends or family, and is deployed to justify both egalitarianism and gender conservatism. Christian students are constructing “everyday theologies” that integrate religious resources with other social resources, generating divergent egalitarian and conservative interpretations, mirroring patterns in “post-feminist” UK society more generally.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The enclosure of cyberspace constitutes a new frontier of capitalism. Yet the Internet continues to facilitate new forms of collaboration and co-creative social relations. Whether this tension will result in a consolidation of capital and its underpinning logic, or lay the foundation for a world of voluntary cooperation, will depend on how these novel phenomena are conceptualised and organised.\\n\\nThis thesis argues that leading commentators on Free Software make two theoretical mistakes which threaten to have grave practical implications. First, they conflate private property (a particular form of property) with the concept of property in general. Second, they misconceive cyberspace – the intangible realm – as distinct from the material world – the tangible realm. Consequently, prevailing property relations in the tangible realm are left unquestioned, while the material underpinning of cyberspace is obscured. By contrast, the thesis aims to show the critical importance of recognising the materiality of the novel phenomena made possible by the Internet. In addition, an examination of concepts of private property in liberal jurisprudence reveals a number of distinct components and potential configurations thereof. It is argued that all relations between people with regard to things can in fact be understood in terms of configurations of these same components. This allows for an understanding of commoning – collective action based on shared values and self-organisation – in terms of property. Free Software, on this model, can be understood as an autonomous commons that has constituted itself through the reconfiguration of a private property right, namely copyright. Conceptualising the relational modalities of Free Software and commoning in terms of property thus feeds back into the concept of property. This understanding can in turn be mapped back onto the tangible realm, reanimating debate about the range of possible property relations more generally.\\n\\nKeywords: anti-capitalism; commoning; commons; copyleft; critical political economy, cyberspace; enclosure; Free Culture; Free Software; hackers; intellectual property rights, internet; jurisprudence; property.',\n",

Our new multidimensional (MD) analysis of the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus identifies clusters of linguistic features along four dimensions, onto which academic disciplines, disciplinary groups, levels of study and genre families are mapped. The dimensions are interpreted through text extracts as: (1) Compressed Procedural Information vs Stance towards the Work of Others; (2) Personal Stance; (3) Possible Events vs Completed Events; and (4) Informational Density.

Current literature focuses heavily on the legacy from hosting sporting events, with little coverage of the impacts experienced from the bidding process. Many cities and regions have competed to host these top tier events with little achievement, or only with success after several times though the cycle. While the International Olympic Committee has given the bid legacies increasing attention in its materials forwarded to Applicant Cities, little research has fully delved into the topic. This research project uses three case study cities: Manchester, Chicago and Istanbul to further explore this topic and employs archive research and semi-structured interviews to ascertain both the tangible and intangible legacies of failed Olympic bids. Data was collected during 2016-17 and the results build upon existing literature, particularly the work of Lauermann (2014, 2016a, 2016b, 2017) and demonstrate that, depending on the initial motivation for the bid, positive outcomes are possible. We argue that in several areas such as community, promotion, urban, infrastructure, hosting capacity, sport networks and social capital legacies are possible, but not automatic for failed bid cities. The findings of the research will be useful for the IOC as it aims to increase the volume of future bids, but also for potential host cities who may wish to maximise their bidding experience.',\n",

However, due to their cost and risks relating to the security of supply, alternative solutions such as ferrite magnets have recently become popular. In this paper, the two major design challenges of using ferrite magnets for a high-torque-density and high-speed application, i.e., their low remanent flux density and low coercivity, are addressed. It is shown that a spoke-type design utilizing a distributed winding may overcome the torque density challenge due to a simultaneous flux concentration and a reluctance torque possibility. Furthermore, the demagnetization challenge can be overcome through the careful optimization of the rotor structure, with the inclusion of nonmagnetic voids on the top and bottom of the magnets. To meet the challenges of a high-speed operation, an extensive rotor structural analysis has been undertaken, during which electromagnetics and manufacturing tolerances are taken into account. Electromagnetic studies are validated through the testing of a prototype, which is custom built for static torque and demagnetization evaluation. The disclosed motor design surpasses the state-of-the-art performance and cost, merging the theories into a multidisciplinary product.',\n",

Drawing upon both the knowledge-based view, and cognitive and dynamic capabilities, we undertook in-depth interviews with directors involved in high-level strategic decision-making. Our data reveal important findings in three areas. First, we find evidence of a shortfall in cognitive capabilities in relation to BD, and issues with cognitive biases and cognitive overload. Second, we reveal the challenges to board cohesion presented by BD. Finally, we show how BD impacts on responsibility/control within senior teams. This study points to areas for development at three levels of our analysis: individual directors, the board, and a broader view of the organisation with its external stakeholders.',\n",

In a counterbalanced order, 12 men and 12 women performed three 10-s sprints using a stationary (0 rev/min), moderate (60 rev/min), and high (120 rev/min) starting cadence. Calculated performance indices were peak power, cadence at peak power, time to peak power, and work to peak power. When the uncorrected method of power determination was applied, there was a main effect for starting cadence in female participants for peak power (stationary 635 +/- 183.7 W, moderate 615.4 +/- 168.9 W, and high 798.4 +/- 120.1 W) and cadence at peak power (89.8 +/- 2.3 rev/min, 87.9 +/- 21.5 rev/min, and 113.1 +/- 12.5 rev/min). For both the uncorrected and directly measured methods of power determination in men and women, there was a main effect for starting cadence for time to peak power and work to peak power. In women, for an uncorrected method of power determination, it can be concluded that starting cadence does affect peak power and cadence at peak power. This effect is, however, negated by a direct-measurement method of power determination. In men and women, for both uncorrected and directly measured methods of power determination, time to peak power and work to peak power were affected by starting cadence. Therefore, a higher-cadence start is unsuitable, particularly when sprint-performance indices are determined from an uncorrected method.',\n",

Consequently, the mix proportioning method most suitable for RA reuse for structural applications has long been debated. This study presents an unconventional mix proportioning method involving recycled fine aggregate (RFA), recycled coarse aggregate (RCA), and steel fibres (SF) for recycled aggregate concrete production. The equivalent mortar volume (EMV) mix proportioning technique developed for concrete containing RCA is extended to incorporate RFA and SF. Five different mixes were formulated using both conventional and the extended EMV mix design methods, to study the flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete beams produced with RA and SF. The results showed that the load bearing capacity of the beam of the mix containing 100% RA and 1% SF prepared using the conventional method, increased by up to 13% and 8% compared to similar mix without SF and the reference mix, respectively. The unconventional beam containing 60% RA showed equal load resistance of 63kN as the reference beam made entirely of NA. Additionally, the unconventional beam had the fewest cracks, least crack width, and visually, the least deflection at the fracture when compared to the other beams with or without SF. This study shows that the extended EMV mix proportioning technique is adequate and offsets the need for SF addition in concrete containing RA.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms. Objectives: To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. Selection criteria: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices. Data collection and analysis: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details. Main results: We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The follow-up in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included beta-blockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates, nitrates, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received non-selective beta-blockers ('beta-blockers') − the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) − died during 8-month to 60-month follow-up. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (beta-blockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; beta-blockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than beta-blockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than beta-blockers alone (OR 3.41, 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in beta-blockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Authors' conclusions: Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with high-risk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than beta-blockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of beta-blockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.\",\n",

Methods: The study was a retrospective investigation of routinely collected data on patients receiving rTMS between 2015 and 2017. Measures used were the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and patient rated Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The outcome data of 73 patients with TRD were analysed. The sample included patients with co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. Results: Response and remission rates, respectively, were 40.4% and 25.5% for the HAM-D; 35.6% and 20.8% for the BDI; and 51.1% and 52.1% for the CGI. Effect sizes were medium (0.54, 0.52 and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The results show that a UK-based clinical service achieves similar results to those published internationally and that clinical rTMS can have significant impact on symptoms of depression in many patients with TRD. Health services are under pressure to make financial savings, investment in rTMS could reduce the long-term treatment costs associated with TRD.',\n",

However, the perception of the public regarding key questions, such as the use, ownership, and disposal of 3D printed remains in courts of law has not yet been established. This study explored whether the creation of 3D printed human remains could be considered as an ethical practice by members of the public. A survey comprised of 36 questions was designed to gather responses from members of the public (n = 400) about their attitudes to the creation and use of 3D printed human remains. A majority of respondents believed it was ethical to use 3D prints in courtroom demonstrations (more than 90%) and that this may help jurors to better understand expert testimony over photographs. Respondents also indicated that the context of the case and whether consent had been received from next of kin were important considerations. The results of this study indicate that there is a recognition that there is a direct connection between 3D printed remains and the individual from whom a print derives, and that there is a clear public interest in ensuring that prints are used ethically and responsibly. Yet there are currently no guidelines for what constitutes best ethical practice for the creation and utilisation of 3D prints. As we look forward, there is a need to identify how best to treat 3D printed remains with dignity and respect in casework in a manner that is also contextually appropriate.',\n",

Employing panel data estimation approaches and further augmented with the cross-validation technique, our results indicate that EU FDI in China is influenced by the host country’s institutions, rendering support to the institutional theory. Our analysis indicates that the rule of law, institutional reforms and the interaction between institutional reforms and R&D have significant effects on FDI inflows in China. Further analysis suggests that the coefficient for the interaction between the rule of law and R&D is positive and significant after World Trade Organisation (WTO) entry implying that the effects of reforms following the WTO entry much outweigh the impact of rule of law in EU firms’ decisions to invest in China.

Recrystallization behaviour on sample surface is studied using a heated stage Scanning Electron Microscopy and Electron Backscattered Diffraction. For the lower annealing temperature of 700 oC with no dwell, almost no recrystallization is observed and microstructure resembles the as-received deformed material with the exception of occasional sub-micron sized nuclei. For the annealing conditions of 800 oC 0 s and 800 oC 2 min, onset and evolution of recrystallization is observed in-situ as a function of the initial as-cold rolled texture. Slower recovery rate of alpha fibre than gamma fibre is observed and confirmed by lower drop in average geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density for un-recrystallized alpha fibres (1.1E+14 m-2 for 700 oC 0 s , 1.4E+14 m-2 for 800 oC 0 s and 4.5E+14 m-2 for 800 oC 2 min) than for un-recrystallized gamma fibre grains (3.0E+14 m-2 for 700 oC 0 s , 6.2E+14 m-2 for 800 oC 0 s and 9.8E+14 m-2 for 800 oC 2 min) during annealing. Strong gamma texture in recrystallized matrix is found for annealing conditions of 800 oC 0 s and 800 oC 2 min. From TEM characterisation it was shown that sub-grain boundaries are decorated with fine precipitates (diameter d < 15 nm) of titanium-vanadium carbides (Ti,V)C for the annealing condition of 700 oC 0 s, which suggests that these precipitates play a major overall role in retardation of the recrystallization kinetics.',\n",

Critical analyses of the SDP sector has suggested that such INGO programmes operate within hegemonic relations in which privileged groups (i.e. the international organisation) maintain a position of benefit and leverage over others (i.e. national organisations in the global south) through social and cultural negotiations. This chapter is based upon the context of Sport INGOs’ tendency to use volunteer-based delivery models within Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which has been described as a prime location for SDP activities (Levermore & Beacom, 2009). Using a combination of post-colonial and social capital theory the chapter draws on the suggestion by Darnell and Hayhurst (2012) to illustrate the perspectives, motivations and personal gains of the SDP sector’s front line: its volunteers, as a topic for critical inquiry. In doing so, compares the motives of international volunteers from a global north country (UK) and national volunteers from a global south nation (Cameroon) who work together on the same programme. In order to understand the context of international and national sports volunteers, the chapter comprises of the following sections. Beginning with an outline of the academic context and analytical frameworks of post-colonial and social capital theory, we then move onto an introduction of the research context and methodology. Next, drawing on empirical data we highlight the key similarities and differences of international sports volunteers from Cricket Without Boundaries (CWB) and national sports volunteers from Cameroon Cricket Federation (CCF) who have volunteered on a two week project in Cameroon. Finally, we reflect on the data within the context of the theoretical frameworks introduced earlier.

However, the relatively low electrical conductivity of aluminum compared to copper needs to be overcome. Precompressed motor coils have been shown to produce very high fill factors (> 75%), reducing dc-winding losses, therefore enabling the use of aluminum conductors. However, the single-stranded conductors used can be prone to high ac losses due to skin and proximity effects. Therefore, a method of manufacture of precompressed coils made from stranded/Litz wire is needed, allowing ac losses to be reduced to low levels. This paper describes the development and test of stranded, precompressed aluminum coils, which have been developed for use in an automotive traction application.',\n",

Most patient complaints in developed health care systems result from ineffective communication including: inadequate information provision; not feeling listened to; failure to value patients concerns; and patients not feeling involved in care decisions. Advanced communication skills training is now embedded within cancer care policy in the United Kingdom and now features prominently within cancer education in many countries. Here we share findings from a research evaluation of an Advanced Communication Skills Training program dedicated to health professionals caring for children and young people with cancer. We evaluated participants’ (n = 59) perceptions of the program, impact on their skills, knowledge, competence and confidence. An Appreciative Inquiry design was adopted; data included interviews, pre-post course evaluations, e-mail blog survey and 360-degree reflective work records. The framework approach underpinned data analysis and triangulation of data sets. Key findings highlighted good and poor practice in health professionals’ engagement with children, young people and their families; the purpose of communicating effectively was not always consistent with collaborative working. Attending a program helped participants expand their knowledge of communication theories and strategies. Participants valued using simulated scenarios to develop their skills, and were keen to use their new skills to enhance care delivery. Our emphasis within this evaluation, however remained on what was communicated, when and how, rather than to what effect. The impact of programs such as these must now be evaluated in terms of patient benefit.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Facial nerve palsy leaves people unable to move muscles on the affected side of their face. Challenges exist in patients accessing facial neuromuscular retraining (NMR), a therapy used to strengthen muscle and improve nerve function. Access to therapy could potentially be improved through the use of digital technology. However, there is limited research available on patients' and clinicians' views about the potential benefits of such telerehabilitation based on their lived experiences of treatment pathways. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to gather information about facial palsy treatment pathways in the United Kingdom, barriers to accessing NMR, factors influencing patient adherence, measures used to monitor recovery, and the potential value of emerging wearable digital technology. METHODS: Separate surveys of patients with facial palsy and facial therapy specialists were conducted. Questionnaires explored treatment pathways and views on telerehabilitation, were co-designed with users, and followed a similar format to enable cross-referencing of responses. A follow-up survey of national specialists investigated methods used to monitor recovery in greater detail. Analysis of quantitative data was conducted allowing for data distribution. Open-text responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients with facial palsy and 25 specialist therapists completed the national surveys. Significant variations were observed in individual treatment pathways. Patients reported an average of 3.27 (SD 1.60) different treatments provided by various specialists, but multidisciplinary team reviews were rare. For patients diagnosed most recently, there was evidence of more rapid initial prescribing of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and earlier referral for NMR therapy. Barriers to NMR referral included difficulties accessing funding, shortage of specialist therapists, and limited awareness of NMR among general practitioners. Patients traveled long distances to reach an NMR specialist center; 9% (8/93) of adults reported traveling ≥115 miles. The thematic content analysis demonstrates positive attitudes to the introduction of digital technology, with similar incentives and barriers identified by both patients and clinicians. The follow-up survey of 28 specialists uncovered variations in the measures currently used to monitor recovery and no agreed definitions of a clinically significant change for any of these. The main barriers to NMR adherence identified by patients and therapists could all be addressed by using suitable real-time digital technology. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide valuable information on facial palsy treatment pathways and views on the future introduction of digital technology. Possible ways in which emerging sensor-based digital technology can improve rehabilitation and provide more rigorous evidence on effectiveness are described. It is suggested that one legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be lower organizational barriers to this introduction of digital technology to assist NMR delivery, especially if cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.\",\n",

Furthermore, this study examines the moderating effects of attachment styles on these relationships.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach\\nThe study is based on a survey of 432 respondents, and the data are analysed using the structural equation modelling approach.\\n\\nFindings\\nThis study empirically supports that brand attachment and attachment styles (i.e. anxiety attachment and avoidance attachment) are distinct. Brand attachment influences consumers’ not only positive behaviour (i.e. brand loyalty) but also negative behaviours, such as trash-talking, schadenfreude and anti-brand actions. The findings of the study suggest that only avoidance attachment style moderates the relationships between brand attachment and these consumer behaviours. The link between brand attachment and brand loyalty is attenuated for high-attachment-avoidance consumers. In contrast, the links between brand attachment and trash-talking, schadenfreude and anti-brand actions are strengthened.\\n\\nPractical implications\\nThis study assists marketing managers in understanding that a strong brand attachment may result in negative behaviours that can harm a company’s brand image. Thus, building a strong relationship with consumers will not always be beneficial. Companies should be aware of the consequences of building relationships with consumers who have a high level of attachment anxiety and/or avoidance.\\n\\nOriginality/value\\nThis paper highlights that brand attachment not only influences brand loyalty behaviour but also three negative behaviours: trash-talking, schadenfreude and anti-brand actions. Moreover, the links between brand attachment and negative behaviours are strengthened when consumers have a high level of attachment avoidance.',\n",

Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective intervention resulting in sustained weight loss and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. However, the outcomes of BS in older patients are unknown.\\n\\nMethods: A retrospective study utilising the bariatric database from a single UK NHS BS centre. We identified all older patients, aged ≥65 years old at surgery, who had BS between 2003 and 2013 and all were matched to 2 ‘typical’ aged controls (38 – 53 years old, the age IQR for BS patients at our centre) for surgical procedure, gender, referral body mass index (BMI) and diabetes status. Data were obtained from both local and GP records. Survival was compared between cases and matched controls using Kaplan-Meier estimators and the log rank test up to 5-years post-operatively.\\n\\nResults: The mean age (S.D.) for cases (n=41) and controls (n=82) were 67 (2.3) and 46 years (5.1), respectively. Mean BMI was 47 kg/m2 (7.2), 34% were men and 59% had Type 2 diabetes. There was 0% mortality in both cases and controls at 30-days post-operative. Over 5-years post-operative follow-up; there was 9.8% (n=4) mortality in older adults (9.8%) 1.2% mortality (n=1) in controls (P=0.03). No deaths were due to surgical complication. At 5-years post-operative, BMI reduction in older adults (7.2±6.1 kg/m2) was significantly less than younger controls (11.6±8.6 kg/m2) (t(72)=−2.218, P=0.030). Meanwhile there was no significant difference in change in HbA1c among patients with Type 2 Diabetes (P=0.516).\\n\\nConclusion: In older adults, BS was not associated with increased 30-day mortality or surgical-related mortality up to 5 years post-surgery. BS resulted in clinically meaningful BMI reductions in older patients at 5 years post-surgery. However, BMI reductions were significantly greater in younger patients at 5 years post-surgery. The impact of surgery on glycaemic control was similar across older and younger adults with Type 2 diabetes. BS is a valid option of treatment in older patients with obesity, future studies need to examine the impact of surgery on functionality and quality of life in this patient group.',\n",

We apply a food justice lens with a focus on place and power to explore UA's contributions to livelihoods and food availability in Cape Town, South Africa and Maputo, Mozambique and to understand the power dynamics between actors. We conducted household surveys, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, participant observations, and farmer-led co-research from 2017 to 2019. In Cape Town, UA is an NGO-led, subsidised initiative regulating production decisions and market access, instead of enhancing self-determination. Food is produced in highly confined spaces in informal settlements, almost exclusively for a niche market of wealthy consumers in the city centre. Farmers are disconnected from consumers and from their own produce, with only 15% of farmers eating the vegetables they grow. In Maputo, UA emerged from farming traditions in the peri-urban green belt, producing leafy green vegetables for both the urban population and 99% of the farmers themselves, thereby contributing to local food availability. However, farmers depend on prices determined by intermediaries with farm association members of higher status and privilege holding leading positions and determining access to agricultural inputs and services. In both contexts, we revealed stark structural inequalities and highly uneven power dynamics. As one outcome of co-research in Cape Town, farmers established their own market channels and advocated for food councils that would enable them to have a voice in shaping urban agriculture and local food systems.\",\n",

The results showed high UCS and tensile strength with the addition of 10% BDW to the concrete mix, hence achieving the set target in accordance with the relevant British standards. A gradual reduction in strength was observed as BDW content increases, however, recording good workability as slump and compaction index results fell within the set target range in accordance with relevant British standards.

Based on a PhD thesis by John Martin Pedersen, it is divided in to four parts with a preface co-authored by Massimo de Angelis.\\n\\nLonger version:\\n\\nThe enclosure of cyberspace constitutes a new frontier of capitalism. Yet the Internet continues to facilitate new forms of collaboration and co-creative social relations. Whether this tension will result in a consolidation of capital and its underpinning logic, or lay the foundation for a world of voluntary cooperation, will depend on how these novel phenomena are conceptualised and organised.\\n\\nThis thesis argues that leading commentators on Free Software make two theoretical mistakes which threaten to have grave practical implications. First, they conflate private property (a particular form of property) with the concept of property in general. Second, they misconceive cyberspace – the intangible realm – as distinct from the material world – the tangible realm. Consequently, prevailing property relations in the tangible realm are left unquestioned, while the material underpinning of cyberspace is obscured. By contrast, the thesis aims to show the critical importance of recognising the materiality of the novel phenomena made possible by the Internet. In addition, an examination of concepts of private property in liberal jurisprudence reveals a number of distinct components and potential configurations thereof. It is argued that all relations between people with regard to things can in fact be understood in terms of configurations of these same components. This allows for an understanding of commoning – collective action based on shared values and self-organisation – in terms of property. Free Software, on this model, can be understood as an autonomous commons that has constituted itself through the reconfiguration of a private property right, namely copyright. Conceptualising the relational modalities of Free Software and commoning in terms of property thus feeds back into the concept of property. This understanding can in turn be mapped back onto the tangible realm, reanimating debate about the range of possible property relations more generally.\\n\\nKeywords: anti-capitalism; commoning; commons; copyleft; critical political economy, cyberspace; enclosure; Free Culture; Free Software; hackers; intellectual property rights, internet; jurisprudence; property.\\n\\nSee also: https://thecommoner.org/back-issues/issue-14-winter-2010/',\n",

These two lenses were extended in that context to help locate issues, clarify problems and situate what we can learn from choreographic practice and empirical studies of dance.\\nThe first lens is a framework for describing what goes on in the making of an artwork or design processes in general. The second lens is that of mental architecture applied here to examine how the multiple components of the human mind work together in creative and performance contexts.

The choice of samples is guided by the input constraints and previous conflicts. The key idea behind our new approach is to start with a partial sample; demonstrate that it cannot be extended to a full sample; and from the reasons for that rule out a larger space around the partial sample, which build up incrementally into a cylindrical algebraic covering of the space. There are similarities with the incremental variant of CAD, the NLSAT method of Jovanović and de Moura, and the NuCAD algorithm of Brown; but we present worked examples and experimental results on a preliminary implementation to demonstrate the differences to these, and the benefits of the new approach.',\n",

Methods: The study was a retrospective investigation of routinely collected data on patients receiving rTMS between 2015 and 2018. Measures used were the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and patient rated Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7). The outcome data of 144 patients with TRD was analysed. The sample included patients with co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. Results: Response and remission rates respectively were 34.6% and 20.6% for the HAM-D; 10% and 28.6% for the PHQ-9; 31% and 31.8% for the CGI; and 24.6% and 28.8% for GAD-7. Effect sizes were mostly medium (0.48, 0.27, 0.51, 0.43 respectively). GAD-7 reliable change improvement was 56.1% and PHQ-9 reliable change improvement was 40%. There was a medium positive correlation between anxiety (GAD-7) and depression recovery (HAM-D), r = 0.31, n = 46, p = 0.039, with lower pre-treatment anxiety associated with lower post-treatment HAM-D scores. Conclusions: TRD patients with low pre-treatment anxiety levels respond to treatment better than those with high pre-treatment anxiety. The results show that a clinical rTMS service can have a significant impact on symptoms of depression and anxiety in TRD.

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years of diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, which include endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical portocaval shunts, among others. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms. Objectives: To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for secondary prevention according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and a previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. Selection criteria: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had no previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices, previous history of bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those who had acute bleeding at the time of treatment, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results: We included a total of 48 randomised clinical trials (3526 participants) in the review. Forty-six trials (3442 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies. The follow-up ranged from two months to 61 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 12 interventions were compared in these trials (sclerotherapy, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, no active intervention, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), beta-blockers plus nitrates, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy plus nitrates). Overall, 22.5% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) of sclerotherapy died during the follow-up period ranging from two months to 61 months. There was considerable uncertainty in the effects of interventions on mortality. Accordingly, none of the interventions showed superiority over another. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in fewer serious adverse events (number of people) than sclerotherapy (OR 0.19; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.54; 1 trial; 100 participants). Based on low or very low-certainty evidence, the adverse events (number of participants) and adverse events (number of events) may be different across many comparisons; however, these differences are due to very small trials at high risk of bias showing large differences in some comparisons leading to many differences despite absence of direct evidence. Based on low-certainty evidence, TIPS may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation (HR 0.12; 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.41; 1 trial; 58 participants). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, any variceal rebleed was probably lower in sclerotherapy than in no active intervention (HR 0.62; 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.99, direct comparison HR 0.66; 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.13; 3 trials; 296 participants), beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy than sclerotherapy alone (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.37 to 0.95; direct comparison HR 0.50; 95% CrI 0.07 to 2.96; 4 trials; 231 participants); TIPS than sclerotherapy (HR 0.18; 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.38; direct comparison HR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.01 to 7.51; 2 trials; 109 participants), and in portocaval shunt than sclerotherapy (HR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.77; no direct comparison) groups. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more, other compensation, events than sclerotherapy (rate ratio 2.37; 95% CrI 1.35 to 4.67; 1 trial; 65 participants and rate ratio 2.30; 95% CrI 1.20 to 4.65; 2 trials; 109 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions including those related to beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation in the remaining comparisons. Authors' conclusions: The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on mortality. Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapy. TIPS might result in a large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy probably results in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than no active intervention. Beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than sclerotherapy. Beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more other compensation events than sclerotherapy. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials are needed.\",\n",

Our study finds that firms with higher conflicts of interest among managers and shareholders pay lower dividends. In the context of the conflicts of interest among major and minor shareholders, we find that such conflicts would exert little impact on dividend payments. Further, we find that the family-controlled firms prefer to pay less dividends whereas the corporations with higher state ownership are associated with larger dividend payments. Our findings are in line with the argument that the Indonesian state consider corporate dividends as one of the main sources of revenues other than corporate taxes in their government budget.

       "  'abstract': 'Since the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) became main-stream with the launch of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the use of rare earth magnets in vehicle traction motors has become common. In particular the rare earth based, hard magnetic material Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) has offered significant performance benefits, not possible with other technologies, enabling the development of compact, torque- and power-dense electric traction motors. This trend has continued as mass market Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) such as the Nissan Leaf, have come to market. However in 2011–2012 the price of these materials rose significantly, owing to geopolitical concerns relating to security of supply. Whilst the price has recovered more recently closer to historical levels, concern still remains in the minds of governments and many manufacturers of hybrid and electric vehicles. Reports have also raised questions over the environmental sustainability of these materials and this has further encouraged users to consider alternatives. This paper therefore examines why these magnetic materials have been so successful in traction motor applications. It also explores the alternatives, including those which are ready for market and those which are in the process of being developed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background:\\n\\nFacial nerve paralysis (FNP) is the most common sudden onset disorder affecting a single nerve, leaving patients unable to move muscles on the affected side of the face. Patients with FNP may experience challenges in accessing facial neuromuscular retraining (NMR), a therapy used to increase muscle and improve nerve function health care. Access and therapy delivery could potentially be improved via telerehabilitation. However, there is limited research on patients’ and clinicians’ experiences of FNP treatment pathways, or their views about the benefits of digital technology to assist NMR.\\n\\nObjective:\\n\\nThis study aimed to gather evidence about FNP treatment pathways in the UK, barriers to accessing NMR, factors influencing patient adherence, measures used to monitor recovery, and the potential value of an emerging wearable digital technology.\\n\\nMethods:\\n\\nNational surveys of (1) facial palsy patients and (2) facial therapy specialists to gather evidence. Questionnaires were co-designed with users, and followed a similar format to enable cross-referencing of responses. A follow-on survey (3) of national specialists investigated outcomes used to monitor recovery in greater detail. Analysis of closed questions dependent on data distribution; open text responses analysed using thematic content analysis.\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nNational survey responses included (1) 216 facial palsy patients and (2) 25 specialist therapists. Significant variations observed in treatment pathways. Evidence of more rapid initial prescribing of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and earlier referral for NMR therapy in cases diagnosed more recently. Patients report 3·27 (SD=1.60) treatments provided by different specialists, but multidisciplinary team reviews are rare. Barriers to NMR referral include difficulties accessing funding, shortage of specialist therapists, and limited awareness of NMR amongst general practitioners (GPs); 33% of GP referrals initiated by patients themselves. Patients travel long distance to reach an NMR specialist centre; 8.6% travel ≥ 115 miles. Thematic content analysis demonstrates positive attitudes to the introduction of digital technology among patients and clinicians, with similar incentives and barriers identified by both. Follow-on survey (3) 28 specialists show no consistency in measures used to monitor recovery, or in the definitions of a clinically significant change. Three main barriers to NMR adherence are identified by therapists and patients, all of which can be addressed by a suitable digital technology.\\n\\nConclusions:\\n\\nThis study provides evidence on patients’ and clinicians’ experiences of FNP treatment pathways, and their views on the value of digital technology to enhance provision of NMR and improve outcomes. Possible ways in which the emerging digital technology can improve therapy provision and provide more rigorous evidence on effectiveness are described. The study highlights the need to better understand patients’ and clinicians’ experiences. It is suggested that one legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be lower organisational barriers to this digital technology introduction, especially if cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.

However, it is not clear whether social deprivation has an impact on accessing and the outcomes of bariatric surgery. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of indices of deprivation on access to bariatric surgery and its outcomes.\\n\\nMethods: Cross-sectional prospective evaluation in a single centre in England of all patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery in 2016. Deprivation was assessed using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) (2015), which ranks areas within England from the most (IMD Decile=1) to least deprived (IMD Decile=10). We extracted lower-layer super output area IMD Deciles according to the patients post code at time of bariatric surgery as well as the 12-month post-surgical weight loss and type of surgery.\\n\\nResults: Of the 183 patients who underwent bariatric surgery, 55% (n=102) lived in areas within the 1-3rd IMD Decile (most deprived areas) (27% (4-6th) and 17% (7-10th) IMD Decile). There was no relationship between the type of bariatric surgery offered and IMD Decile. There was no relationship between IMD Decile tertiles (1-3,4-7, 7-10) and % weight loss at one year either across all bariatric surgical interventions (r2=0.019, P=0.09; r2=0.012, P=0.17) or when analysed according to surgery type.\\n\\nConclusions: People undergoing bariatric surgery typically lived in more deprived areas which might be anticipated by the correlation between deprivation and obesity as well as the relative levels of deprivation within our catchment area suggesting by this measure that deprivation is not a clear barrier to accessing bariatric surgery, however data was not available on patients who did not undergo surgery and this may reveal potential inequalities with accessing bariatric surgery both at the point of referral from primary care as well as in the transition from Tier 3 to Tier 4 services. Deprivation does not seem to have an effect on weight loss at 1 year post bariatric surgery. This data suggests that the bariatric surgery service is accessible to people across all IMD Deciles within our catchment area.\\n\\nKeywords: Obesity, social deprivation, healthcare inequa',\n",

Study 1a was based on a mail survey of 280 respondents, whereas Study 1b was based on an electronic survey of 152 respondents. Study 1b was conducted to test the external validity of the research model.\\n\\nFindings\\nIn Study 1a, ideal self-congruence affects emotional brand attachment and in turn emotional brand attachment affects compulsive buying behaviour and external trash-talking. The mediation analysis indicates that emotional brand attachment mediates the relationships. Study 1b offers support to the results of Study 1a.\\n\\nPractical implications\\nFrom a practical point of view, this study is useful for policymakers seeking to regulate and prevent excessive consumerism. For marketers, they should understand that brand attachment leads to compulsive buying and external trash-talking, which may provide immediate benefit for the brand or the firm. However, marketers should understand that these two negative behaviours may harm the firm image and consumers’ well-being in the long run.\\n\\nSocial implications\\nApart from practical implications, firms should consider alleviating compulsive buying, as it is harmful to society. Similarly, excessive external trash-talking may lead to physical aggression. Consumers expect firms to be socially responsible. Thus, firms should start conducting activities that promote responsible shopping and reduce external trash-talking.\\n\\nOriginality/value\\nThe study highlights a dark side of ideal self-congruence and brand attachment. The results suggest that ideal self-congruence with the help of emotional brand attachment predicts compulsive buying behaviour and external trash-talking. This may not only damage brand image but also the consumers’ well-being.',\n",

This paper offers an insight into the development of 3D printing in forensic practice and how 3D printing is currently being used in the criminal justice system in England and Wales. A series of case reports were gathered from multiple police forces and forensic practitioners in the UK to identify how 3D printing was being used. These discussions established who was requesting 3D printed exhibits, what type of technologies were being utilised, what type of exhibits were being printed, and resulting feedback for the use of 3D printed material within a criminal case. As a result, this research demonstrates the current use of 3D printing in England and Wales, discussing the associated cases that have been known to incorporate 3D prints. Likewise, this work explores the limitations that have been encountered by forensic practitioners and identifies a series of research questions that should be considered in future investigations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Concerns about water security often inform climate risk-related decisions made by environmentally focused investors (Porritt, The world in context: Beyond the business case for sustainable development. HRH The Prince of Wales’ Business and the Environment Programme, Cambridge Programme for Industry, 2001; Stern, Stern Review executive summary. New Economics Foundation, 2006). Yet, potential liabilities for damage caused by extreme flood and drought events linked to global warming present risks that are not always reflected in share prices (Krosinsky et al., Evolutions in sustainable investing: Strategies, funds and thought leadership. John Wiley & Sons, 2012). Considering the highly destructive nature of such events, we query whether companies, or specific sectors, could and should be held at least partially liable for their emission-releasing business activities. Recent articles (Rayer & Millar, Citywire Wealth Manager®, (429), p. 36, 2018a; Rayer et al., Ecological, societal, and technological risks and the financial sector, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 39–68, 2020) estimate that under a hypothetical climate liability regime, North Atlantic hurricane seasons might increasingly generate 1–2% losses on market capitalizations (or share prices) for the top seven carbon-emitting, publicly listed companies. In this chapter, we extend the concept of the climate liability regime to estimate the impact of global flood- and drought-related damages on the share prices of nine fossil-fuel firms (including the seven mentioned by Rayer et al. [Ecological, societal, and technological risks and the financial sector, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 39–68, 2020]). Following Rayer et al. (Global warming and extreme weather investment risks (abstract) [Conference session], 2019; Ecological, societal, and technological risks and the financial sector, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 39–68, 2020), we use incremental climate impacts and historical corporate emissions to estimate that climate change-related global flood and drought damages for the period of 2012 to 2016 amount to approximately 2–3% of the top nine carbon-emitting companies’ market capitalizations. Quantifying impacts from extreme weather events increase salience and serve as an example of how science can identify and address the important business questions, pertinent to both investors and companies that arise from a changing climate.',\n",

The interphase precipitation reaction is a transient process lending itself strongly to take advantage of in-situ characterization techniques. The austenite/ferrite interface kinetics during isothermal transformation at 1003 K is measured using HT-CSLM, the pre-exponential effective mobility constant was found to be mobility 0.822 (m J)/(mole s). The V interphase precipitation is characterised using TEM at isothermal transformation temperatures of 923 and 973 K as having inter-sheet spacing of 22±7 and 32±9 nm respectively. Interphase precipitation inter-sheet-spacing is simulated using a revised Quasi-Ledge model and qualitatively predicts the observed trends observed for inter-sheet spacing. The results of in-situ characterisation and modelling suggest that it is possible to optimize the strengthening potential of the precipitation processes by controlling the thermal processing of microalloyed HSLA.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Approximately 40% to 95% of people with liver cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed within about one to three years after diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, including, among others, endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, somatostatin analogues, vasopressin analogues, and balloon tamponade. However, there is uncertainty surrounding the individual and relative benefits and harms of these treatments. Objectives: To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis, through a network meta-analysis; and to generate rankings of the different treatments for acute bleeding oesophageal varices, according to their benefits and harms. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until 17 December 2019, to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in people with cirrhosis and acute bleeding from oesophageal varices. Selection criteria: We included only RCTs (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and acutely bleeding oesophageal varices. We excluded RCTs in which participants had bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those in whom initial haemostasis was achieved before inclusion into the trial, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS software, using Bayesian methods, and calculated the differences in treatments using odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed also the direct comparisons from RCTs using the same codes and the same technical details. Main results: We included a total of 52 RCTs (4580 participants) in the review. Forty-eight trials (4042 participants) were included in one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those with and without a previous history of bleeding. We included outcomes assessed up to six weeks. All trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 19 interventions were compared in the trials (sclerotherapy, somatostatin analogues, vasopressin analogues, sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues, variceal band ligation, balloon tamponade, somatostatin analogues plus variceal band ligation, nitrates plus vasopressin analogues, no active intervention, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade plus somatostatin analogues, balloon tamponade plus vasopressin analogues, variceal band ligation plus vasopressin analogues, balloon tamponade plus nitrates plus vasopressin analogues, balloon tamponade plus variceal band ligation, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and sclerotherapy plus vasopressin analogues). We have reported the effect estimates for the primary and secondary outcomes when there was evidence of differences between the interventions against the reference treatment of sclerotherapy, but reported the other results of the primary and secondary outcomes versus the reference treatment of sclerotherapy without the effect estimates when there was no evidence of differences in order to provide a concise summary of the results. Overall, 15.8% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment of sclerotherapy (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) died during the follow-up periods, which ranged from three days to six weeks. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, somatostatin analogues alone had higher mortality than sclerotherapy (OR 1.57, 95% CrI 1.04 to 2.41; network estimate; direct comparison: 4 trials; 353 participants) and vasopressin analogues alone had higher mortality than sclerotherapy (OR 1.70, 95% CrI 1.13 to 2.62; network estimate; direct comparison: 2 trials; 438 participants). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, a higher proportion of people receiving balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy had more serious adverse events than those receiving only sclerotherapy (OR 4.23, 95% CrI 1.22 to 17.80; direct estimate; 1 RCT; 60 participants). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, people receiving vasopressin analogues alone and those receiving variceal band ligation had fewer adverse events than those receiving only sclerotherapy (rate ratio 0.59, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.96; network estimate; direct comparison: 1 RCT; 219 participants; and rate ratio 0.40, 95% CrI 0.21 to 0.74; network estimate; direct comparison: 1 RCT; 77 participants; respectively). Based on low-certainty evidence, the proportion of people who developed symptomatic rebleed was smaller in people who received sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues than those receiving only sclerotherapy (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.94; direct estimate; 1 RCT; 105 participants). The evidence suggests considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons where sclerotherapy was the control intervention. Authors' conclusions: Based on moderate-certainty evidence, somatostatin analogues alone and vasopressin analogues alone (with supportive therapy) probably result in increased mortality, compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, vasopressin analogues alone and band ligation alone probably result in fewer adverse events compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Based on low-certainty evidence, balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy may result in large increases in serious adverse events compared to sclerotherapy. Based on low-certainty evidence, sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues may result in large decreases in symptomatic rebleed compared to sclerotherapy. In the remaining comparisons, the evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the interventions, compared to sclerotherapy.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Since the start of the new millennium in the UK, a range of new feminist activities - national networks, issue-specific campaigns, local groups, festivals, magazines and blogs - have been formed by a new constituency of mostly younger women and men. These new feminist activities, which we term 'third-wave' feminism, have emerged in a 'post-feminist' context, in which feminism is considered dead or unnecessary, and where younger feminists, if represented at all, are often dismissed as insufficiently political. Representations of North American third-wave feminism are brought into play in these criticisms of the UK third wave, and insufficient attention has been paid to the distinctiveness of the UK contexts. Drawing on data from a survey of 1,265 people involved in post-2000 forms of feminism and semi-structured interviews with 30 feminist activists, the article sketches out the contours of the contemporary feminist movement and its activists, activism and priorities. It attends to differences and similarities between second and third waves, and situates contemporary UK feminism in its distinctive UK context. Arguing that feminism is both alive and relevant for significant numbers of people in the UK today, the paper interrogates younger feminists' reluctance to use the term 'third-wave feminism' to describe themselves, attributing this reluctance to ambivalent and cynical representations of the third wave in academic literature and the popular media.\",\n",

This paper describes the development of a variant of the SRM, utilizing a segmental rotor construction, which has previously been demonstrated to provide the potential for significant improvement in torque densities compared with SRMs with a conventional toothed rotor construction. This paper describes a strategy that has been developed to optimize the Segmental Rotor SRM to maximize efficiency with the aim of achieving performance equivalent to that of the 80-kW interior permanent-magnet machine utilized in Nissan's LEAF electric vehicle. Optimization applies a combination of static and dynamic analyses in order to achieve a full and computationally efficient assessment of motor performance across different regions of the torque speed envelope.

This paper presents the result of investigations into the mix design of RAC. The study examined experimentally two conventional and one unconventional mix design methods. The conventional methods include the absolute volume approach according to the American Concrete Institute (ACI) standard and the Department of Environment (DoE) concrete mix design method given by the British specification. The unconventional method is a new technique dubbed “Equivalent mortar volume (EMV)” method developed to incorporate both fine and coarse recycled aggregates for RAC production. A total of four mixes were designed as follows: (1) natural aggregate concrete regarded as the reference mix using the ACI guide, (2) RAC using the ACI guide, (3) RAC using the DoE guide and (4) blended aggregate concrete using the EMV guide. Fresh concrete properties were tested, and twenty concrete cubes and eighteen cylinders were produced accordingly and tested after curing by water immersion for density, compressive strength, tensile splitting strength and water absorption. The results showed that the EMV mix design method used significantly lesser amount of cement to achieve a RAC of higher strength than those obtained from its comparable conventional methods even with original natural aggregates. This is the first work on mix design of RAC incorporating both coarse and fine crushed concrete aggregates carried out using the EMV method. This research highlights that the ACI and DoE mix design method guides should be reviewed and amended appropriately, before adopting them for RAC mix design.',\n",

This study investigated formal (organisational) and informal exchange relations and the association with food security within ego (N=561) and whole networks (N=54) among farm workers and their households on three commercial farms. All households were food insecure, with mildly food insecure actors (n=22) showing significantly smaller-sized networks with regard to total number of ties and food exchange ties compared to moderately food insecure actors (n=32). Informal exchange networks were largely kin-related and characterised by low economic status, located within a 50 km radius. While these networks represented an important strategy to cope with food insecurity, farm workers lack bridging ties to actors (individuals or institutions) outside the farm who may enable access to information and opportunities to mobilise resources towards enhancing food security and livelihoods in the long term. Shop owners and farm owners occupy a central position in the networks, highlighting dependency and ongoing paternalistic structures. This study contributes empirical data to the scarce literature on network analysis in the context of food security in South Africa, providing in-depth insights on a population that is formally employed, but remains poor, marginalised and forgotten in contemporary debates on food and nutrition security. Efforts to implement existing policies remain crucial to enable farm workers to access resource-rich networks, including socially more advantaged actors or organisations, in order to achieve better livelihoods outcomes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"3D techniques are increasingly being used by forensic scientists in crime reconstruction. The proliferation of 3D techniques, such as 3D imaging and printing being employed across the various stages of the forensic science process, means that the use of 3D should be considered as a distinct field within forensic science. '3D Forensic Science' ('3DFS') is therefore presented in this paper as a field that brings together a range of 3D techniques and approaches that have been developed within different areas of forensic science for achieving crime reconstructions and interpreting and presenting evidence. It is argued that by establishing this distinct field, defining its boundaries, and developing expertise, best practice and standards, the contribution of 3DFS to the criminal justice system can be maximised and the accuracy and robustness of crime reconstruction endeavours can be enhanced.\",\n",

It is a period that is associated with nonadherence and disen- gagement with care. Objective: To explore the experiences of young liver transplant recipients transitioning to adult services and determine what they require in order to achieve a successful move. The research also explored the possibility of using a mobile phone application (app) as a tool to support transition. Design: Qualitative approach using novel arts-based focus groups and one-to-one interviews. Participants: Twenty-one young people aged 16 to 25 years, 16 health-care professionals involved in their care, and 7 young people as follow-up. Participants used services provided by the 3 liver centers in England (Leeds, Bir- mingham, and London). Results: Data highlighted the variability of transition pathways in England for young people moving from child to adult health services. The results showed that they required clear information regarding transition processes including specific medical information and that there was a shortfall in such information. Support was required in the form of a designated transition coordinator or similar specialist who could act as a point of reference and guidance throughout the process. Transitions needed to be individualized and based upon transition readiness rather than age, although the research showed that age cut-offs were still used. Conclusion: Young people welcomed apps to provide information, reminders, contacts, and connections. Future research should explore the efficacy of such apps.',\n",

A study with more than 1,500 CEOs worldwide believes that creating a bond with consumers and continuing to learn how to strengthen the bond are essential for realizing strategies and delivering on shareholder expectations. Not surprisingly, firms and researchers are seeking ways to build a stronger connection with consumers, because such attachment acts as a key requisite in a firm’s success. Consequently, understanding how marketers can intensify the attachment is important. This article offers a framework for building stronger consumers’ attachment and testing it based on a survey of 432 participants. Four factors are deemed to be important: ideal self-congruence, sensory experience, responsiveness, and CSR beliefs. Attachment influences loyalty and resilience to negative information. Additionally, attachment fully mediates ideal self-congruence and responsiveness to loyalty, as well as ideal self-congruence and sensory experience to resilience to negative information.

Advanced techniques such as hot stage electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and fore scattered detection (FSD) allow for direct in-situ observation of these processes to give better and more accurate analysis. This paper investigates two 7000 series alloys with a 1.6 wt% nickel addition and compares the recrystallization behaviours of both. Recrystallization was observed to occur at a higher rate and at a lower initiation temperature of 277 °C in sheet rolled from the original smaller 10 kg cast of material compared to the higher temperature of 285 °C in sheet from a second larger 60 kg cast. In-situ back scattered scans of both alloys microstructures were observed to be near identical to bulk back scattered scans taken from samples recrystallized externally, validating the accuracy of the observed results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper aims to understand the situational rationality of Leeds’ decision to host the Grand Depart of the 2014 Tour de France. In doing so, it explores three distinct objectives. First, it considers the wider aspects of gentrification within the city and the extent to which the Grand Depart contributed to the consolidation of the gentrification programme. Second, it explores, using policy theory, the extent to which the sub-region of Yorkshire was able to win the right to host the event despite not being the first choice of UK Sport. Finally, the paper explores extent to which the event was marketed to the local population and their satisfaction with its delivery.\\nIn accordance with the paper’s three objectives it is underpinned by three broad bodies of literature. Hillier (2000) contends that all potential host cities for large scale sports events face two important issues: the urban impact of events and the ways in which they contribute to urban transformation; and the legitimisation of the event in order to achieve public support. Following previous successes in urban transformation (Gold and Gold, 2008), it is now generally recognised as a requirement that host cities demonstrate a legacy commitment as part of their bid (Bernstock, 2014). Watt (2013), however, contends that these legacy promises have led to a process of residential displacement in which traditional residents and business interests are side-lined in order to make way for those corporate interests associated with the event. Watt goes further to explain that process occurring is not replacement but instead displacement as a replacement downplays the significance of ongoing political and social struggles over space in modern cities. While the notions of class struggles involving manual working classes and ethnically homogenous populations is anachronistic in modern cities, we should not mistake the changing appearance of class with the disappearance of class antagonism (Davidson and Wyly, 2012). Finally, the paper provides development of the currently growing, but limited body of literature concerning how policy decisions to host such events are made at the local and national levels.\\nThe paper draws upon qualitative data in the forms of semi-structured interviews and document research. Interviews were carried out with stakeholders directly involved and affected by the Grand Depart and were carried out in the aftermath of the event. Interview data is supported by content analysis of documentation released before the event in order to draw up public support.\\n*At this stage the data is being analysed, with a guarantee that the results will be available in time for the EASM conference. Tentatively, initial analysis seems to suggest that a process of gentrification, especially relating to the privileging of corporate interests. In addition, the event provides a useful opportunity to examine the effectiveness of the centralisation of UK bidding policy, in that UK Sport’s preferred bidder was not successful.',\n",

They are generally seen as a side effect of this long‐term illness and can severely affect the daily quality of life of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the coping patterns or strategies used by patients and establish whether the phenomenology and behaviours used by patients enabled control of the phenomenon. Demographic and clinical variables were recorded, including motor measures, cognitive status, and depressive symptoms. Patient with hallucinations were at a more advance stage of the disease and displayed more depressive symptoms than their non‐hallucinating counterparts. Most patients used more than one constructive coping strategy, the most common were simple behavioural strategies based around motor action or cognitive approaches resulting in visual modification. In addition, humour was a common technique used by the patients to deal with the phenomenon. Emotional responses varied between patients, but it was found that the actual content of the hallucination was not directly associated with whether it caused trouble to the patient, but perceived stress was strongly correlated with the subjective disturbing nature of visual hallucinations (VHs). This study gives insight into the role of cognitive‐behavioural approaches when dealing with VHs and opens up avenues for future studies in helping patient to deal with hallucinations.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with liver cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is associated with significant short-term mortality; therefore, it is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it. Antibiotic prophylaxis forms the mainstay preventive method, but this has to be balanced against the development of drug-resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is difficult to treat, and other adverse events. Several different prophylactic antibiotic treatments are available; however, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy and optimal combination.\\nOBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits and harms of different prophylactic antibiotic treatments for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis using a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different prophylactic antibiotic treatments according to their safety and efficacy.\\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis at risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis undergoing prophylactic treatment to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation, or were receiving antibiotics for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or other purposes.\\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.\\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 29 randomised clinical trials (3896 participants; nine antibiotic regimens (ciprofloxacin, neomycin, norfloxacin, norfloxacin plus neomycin, norfloxacin plus rifaximin, rifaximin, rufloxacin, sparfloxacin, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim), and 'no active intervention' in the review. Twenty-three trials (2587 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, with or without other features of decompensation, having ascites with low protein or previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. Many of the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Overall, approximately 10% of trial participants developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 15% of trial participants died. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of mortality (very low certainty) or number of serious adverse events (very low certainty). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or the proportion of people with serious adverse events. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of proportion of people with 'any adverse events' (very low certainty), liver transplantation (very low certainty), or the proportion of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (very low certainty). The number of 'any' adverse events per participant was fewer with norfloxacin (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CrI 0.59 to 0.94; 4 trials, 546 participants; low certainty) and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (rate ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.81; 1 trial, 60 participants; low certainty) versus no active intervention. There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of 'any' adverse events per participant (very low certainty). There were fewer other decompensation events with rifaximin versus no active intervention (rate ratio 0.61, 65% CrI 0.46 to 0.80; 3 trials, 575 participants; low certainty) and norfloxacin plus neomycin (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.33; 1 trial, 22 participants; low certainty). There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of decompensations events per participant (very low certainty). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or development of symptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One would expect some correlation between the above outcomes, with interventions demonstrating effectiveness across several outcomes. This was not the case. The possible reasons for this include sparse data and selective reporting bias, which makes the results unreliable. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions from these inconsistent differences based on sparse data. There was no evidence of any differences in the subgroup analyses (performed when possible) based on whether the prophylaxis was primary or secondary.\\nFUNDING: the source of funding for five trials were organisations who would benefit from the results of the study; six trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 18 trials was unclear.\\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid postrandomisation dropouts (or perform intention-to-treat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health-related quality of life, and decompensation events.\",\n",

Different jurisdictions have adopted different approaches towards issuing this controversial remedy. Within the European Union (EU), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU hereafter) in West Tankers imposed a restriction on EU national courts from granting anti-suit injunctions in favour arbitration where the foreign proceeding is in another EU national court. However, with Brexit looming, the UK passed European Withdrawal Act 2018 (EUWA) which gives the UK Supreme Court (UKSC) a legal pathway to overturning West Tankers. This article argues that it is highly likely that post-Brexit the UKSC will overturn West Tankers and thus will regain its power to issue anti-suit injunctions towards EU national courts.

Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are eating disorders that are common in obesity, and may affect the management as well as long term outcomes of T2DM. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the prevalence and associations of BED or NES in adults with T2DM.\\n\\nMethods\\nWe conducted a systematic review. The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and AMED were searched for articles which met the inclusion criteria; including patients >\\u200918 years old, with T2DM, and BED and/or NES. The reference lists of included studies were also searched. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies that measured the outcomes of interest.\\n\\nResults\\nA total of 10 studies (2 included NES) were included in this systematic review. The number screened for BED and NES were 6527 and 1039 participants, respectively. Point prevalence was 1.2–8.0% for BED and 3.8–8.4% for NES. Patients with T2DM and BED had higher BMI than patients with T2DM without BED in the two studies that reported BMI. There was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c between patients with and without BED in the two studies that measured HbA1c.\\n\\nConclusions\\nBED and NES are common in adults with T2DM, and BED is associated with higher BMI in patients with T2DM. However, only two studies reported important outcomes measures such as BMI and HbA1c in patients with T2DM. Hence, further well-designed studies are needed to assess the impact of BED and NES in patients with T2DM. Health Care Professionals should consider the diagnosis of BED and NES in patients with T2DM.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Disparity of attainment between different groups of students in UK higher education has been correlated with ethnicity (UUK & NUS, 2019). For example, students who declared their ethnicity as Black were 20% less likely to graduate with a top classification than those who declared their ethnicity as White (OfS, 2018a). The causes of such attainment gaps are complex, and one important factor may be the nature of the feedback given by academic staff on assignments written by different groups of students. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of investigating this hypothesis by analyzing written feedback and looking for patterns in feedback given to different groups of students. Literature Review: Research on attainment among Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students in the UK has explored a number of aspects, and has generally concluded that there are issues of “belonging” (Richardson, 2015), particularly in institutions where the majority of academic staff and students are White, but that no single variable can explain the disparity. The wording of feedback on lower-scoring papers has been shown to be more impersonal and distant than that given to students on higher-scoring papers (e.g., Gardner, 2004), which has the (unintended) result of increasing the sense of belonging of higher performing students in ways that can build incrementally over the years of a degree course. While there have been many such small-scale studies of written feedback, none have aimed to collect large quantities of authentic written feedback for analysis. Research Questions: The hypotheses that\\u202fdrive our exploration are that\\u202fwritten feedback information (WFI) (Boud & Malloy, 2013) is\\u202fworded differently to different groups of students, and that there is a direct relationship between this aspect of feedback and academic attainment as measured by grades on summative assessments. Specifically, we asked: 1. Can a framework of WFI functions be developed for our data that share a meaningful set of attributes? 2. Can these categories be used to differentiate WFI to different groups of students? Methodology: A small pilot corpus was compiled from written feedback comments on twelve student assignments from two large Faculties. Metadata was added to each file, and the WFI comments were annotated and analyzed according to a framework developed in a branching format through a recursive construction process informed by the literature reviewed and the data in the corpus. This technique was used to characterize the WFI styles of the two Faculties. Results: The results show that all WFI comments could be classified using the novel systematic framework developed, and that its binary nature enabled ready cross-tabulation with metadata variables. Praise and critique were found to be most frequent, with specific praise of ideas (P1A) accounting for 68% of all praise, and specific critique of content (C1A) accounting for 49% of all critique. Observations tend to be the longest feedback comments (average 15.4 words). When the two Faculties are compared, two different feedback styles are evident, with Fac1 providing more advice, query, and observation style feedback than Fac2, and Fac2 providing more praise and critique than Fac1.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper presents the study carried out using the extended Equivalent Mortar Volume (EMV) mix design technique, for concrete made of recycled aggregates (RA) and steel fibre (SF). The expansion of the EMV approach is necessary to encourage the use of fine recycled aggregates (FRA) in concrete manufacture. To this end, the same replacement ratio obtained for coarse recycled aggregates (CRA) using the EMV principles, was applied to the FRA for concrete production. Furthermore, SF was added to improve the mechanical behaviour of RA-concrete developed with this method. Altogether, four mixes were developed using a constant waterto-cement ratio of 0.42 thus: reference mix labelled conventional concrete (CC) prepared with natural aggregates (NA); crushed aggregate concrete (CAC) mix designed with the conventional method and made of 100% RA; blended aggregate concrete (BAC) mix prepared with the EMV guide and composed of both NA and RA; and steel fibre-reinforced blended aggregate concrete (SFRBAC) mix prepared by adding optimum SF to the BAC mix. Then, cubical, cylindrical and prismatic specimens were produced from the mixes to investigate different properties of concrete. The experimental results show that the mechanical properties of concrete are not adversely affected by the presence of FRA. Also, the EMV mix design provision offers a better result than its companion conventional approach, even with about 30% reduction in cement content. The addition of SF mainly controlled crack development and induced a ductile failure mode.',\n",

STIs can have serious health consequences for affected individuals and the estimated annual cost of treatment to the National Health Service is £620 million. Accordingly, the UK government has made reducing the rates of STIs among this group a priority. A missed opportunity to intervene to increase condom use is when young people obtain self-sampling kits for STIs via the internet. Objective: Our aim was to develop a theory-based tailored intervention to increase condom use for 16-24-years-olds accessing chlamydia self-sampling websites. Methods: The intervention, Wrapped, was developed using Intervention Mapping and was co-designed with young people. The following steps were performed: (1) identification of important determinants of condom use and evidence of their changeability using computer and digital interventions; (2) setting the intervention goal, performance objectives, and change objectives; (3) identification of Behavior Change Principles (BCPs) and practical strategies to target these determinants; and (4) development of intervention materials able to deliver the BCPs and practical strategies. Results: Users of existing chlamydia self-sampling websites are signposted to Wrapped after placing an order for a sampling kit. Salient barriers to condom use are identified by each user and relevant intervention components are allocated to target these. The components include the following: (1) a sample box of condoms, (2) an online condom distribution service, (3) a product for carrying condoms, (4) a condom demonstration video, (5) a series of videos on communication about condom use, and (6) erotic films of real couples discussing and demonstrating condom use. Conclusions: This intervention will be directed at young people who may be particularly receptive to messages and support for behavior change due to their testing status.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Indigenous Peoples, especially women and children, are affected disproportionately by malnutrition and diet-related health problems. Addressing this requires an investigation of the structural conditions that underlie unequal access to resources and loss of traditional lifestyles, and necessitates inclusive approaches that shed light onto these issues and provide strategies to leverage change. Indigenous Peoples’ food systems are inextricably connected to land, which in turn is interwoven with issues of self-determination, livelihoods, health, cultural and spiritual heritage, and gender. Ongoing loss of land and the dominant agri-food model further threaten Indigenous Peoples’ food systems. Continuing gender-based discrimination undermines the self-determination and rights of women, and negatively impacts on their health, nutritional status, and overall wellbeing, as well as on the wellbeing of households and communities. We suggest that feminist political ecology and modern matriarchal studies provide holistic interlinking frameworks for investigating underlying issues of power and inequality. We further argue that a focus on the principles of respect, responsibility, and relationships, and an openness to different worldviews, can facilitate a bridging of Indigenous and Western approaches in research and community action conducted in partnership with Indigenous Peoples. This can contribute to creating new ways of knowing regarding Indigenous Peoples’ food systems, equally valuing both knowledge systems. Indigenous Peoples’ rights, right to food, and food sovereignty are frames that, despite some tensions, have the common goal of self-determination. Through their ability to inform, empower, and mobilize, they provide tools for social movements and communities to challenge existing structural inequalities and leverage social change.

Providing high-quality, responsive healthcare for them and for their families presents a significant challenge. Their conditions are often complex and highly unpredictable. Palliative care is advocated for people with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions, but these services for children are highly variable in terms of availability and scope. Little is known about the lived experiences and preferences of children and their families in terms of the palliative care that they do, or do not, receive. This study aims to produce an in-depth insight into the experiences and preferences of such children and families in order to develop recommendations for the future provision of services. The study will be carried out in the West Midlands, UK. Methods and analysis A qualitative study comprising longitudinal interviews over a 12-month period with children (aged 5-18 years) living with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions and their family members. Data analysis will start with thematic analysis, followed by narrative and cross-case analysis to examine changing experiences and preferences over time, at the family level and within the wider healthcare system. Patient and public involvement (PPI) has informed the design and conduct of the study. Findings will be used to develop recommendations for an integrated model of palliative care for children in partnership with the patient and public involvement (PPI) group. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted in September 2016 by the National Health Service Health Research Authority (IRAS ID: 196816, REC reference: 16/WM/0272). Findings will be of immediate relevance to healthcare providers, policy-makers, commissioners and voluntary sector organisations in the UK and internationally. Reports will be prepared for these audiences, as well as for children and their families, alongside academic outputs.',\n",

A questionnaire was designed to explore their commitment for addressing this issue within their investment policies, rather than short-term initiatives. Twelve selected UK-based fund management firms covering 20 funds deemed to have superior ethical investment policies completed the questionnaire. The results suggest that while efforts are being made, the commitment by fund managers to address plastics may be somewhat weak. Plastics may not be taken as seriously as more traditional ethical and sustainability issues such as the “sextet of sin,” animal rights, and fossil divestment. Activity appears to focus on company engagement, which runs a risk of being short term in character. Specific recommendations have been made to strengthen ethical and sustainable fund managers' investment policies on plastics.

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation is considered the definitive treatment for people with liver failure. As part of post-liver transplantation management, immunosuppression (suppressing the host immunity) is given to prevent graft rejections. Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified into those that are used for a short period during the beginning phase of immunosuppression (induction immunosuppression) and those that are used over the entire lifetime of the individual (maintenance immunosuppression), because it is widely believed that graft rejections are more common during the first few months after liver transplantation. Some drugs such as glucocorticosteroids may be used for both induction and maintenance immunosuppression because of their multiple modalities of action. There is considerable uncertainty as to whether induction immunosuppression is necessary and if so, the relative efficacy of different immunosuppressive agents.\\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different induction immunosuppressive regimens in adults undergoing liver transplantation through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different induction immunosuppressive regimens according to their safety and efficacy.\\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until July 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in adults undergoing liver transplantation.\\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults undergoing liver transplantation. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had multivisceral transplantation and those who already had graft rejections.\\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.\\nMAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 25 trials (3271 participants; 8 treatments) in the review. Twenty-three trials (3017 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people undergoing primary liver transplantation for various indications and excluded those with HIV and those with renal impairment. The follow-up in the trials ranged from three to 76 months, with a median follow-up of 12 months among trials. All except one trial were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was very low. Overall, approximately 7.4% of people who received the standard regimen of glucocorticosteroid induction died and 12.2% developed graft failure. All-cause mortality and graft failure was lower with basiliximab compared with glucocorticosteroid induction: all-cause mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CrI 0.31 to 0.93; network estimate, based on 2 direct comparison trials (131 participants; low-certainty evidence)); and graft failure (HR 0.44, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.70; direct estimate, based on 1 trial (47 participants; low-certainty evidence)). There was no evidence of differences in all-cause mortality and graft failure between other induction immunosuppressants and glucocorticosteroids in either the direct comparison or the network meta-analysis (very low-certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of differences in serious adverse events (proportion), serious adverse events (number), renal failure, any adverse events (proportion), any adverse events (number), liver retransplantation, graft rejections (any), or graft rejections (requiring treatment) between other induction immunosuppressants and glucocorticosteroids in either the direct comparison or the network meta-analysis (very low-certainty evidence). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the studies reported health-related quality of life.\\nFUNDING: the source of funding for 14 trials was drug companies who would benefit from the results of the study; two trials were funded by neutral organisations who have no vested interests in the results of the study; and the source of funding for the remaining nine trials was unclear.\\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on low-certainty evidence, basiliximab induction may decrease mortality and graft failure compared to glucocorticosteroids induction in people undergoing liver transplantation. However, there is considerable uncertainty about this finding because this information is based on small trials at high risk of bias. The evidence is uncertain about the effects of different induction immunosuppressants on other clinical outcomes, including graft rejections. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid post-randomisation dropouts (or perform intention-to-treat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, and health-related quality of life.\",\n",

The design and manufacture of the compressed coils is also discussed.

The proportion of weight loss from start of MWM to 12\\u2009months post-surgery attributed to GLP-1RA treatment was negatively associated with that attributed to surgery, after adjustment. In conclusion, weight change after GLP-1RA treatment predicted the weight loss achieved by a combination of MWM and bariatric surgery, but not weight loss induced by surgery only. Failure to lose weight after GLP-1RA treatment should not be considered a barrier to undergoing bariatric surgery.',\n",

However, protection provided by cathodic protection is dependent on several parameters such as concrete resistivity, applied current density and the geometrical arrangement of anode and cathode. For the first time, the distribution of potential and protection current along different layers of reinforcement in concrete is numerically investigated. A parametric study was done to analyse the effect of applied current density and concrete resistivity on protection achieved by different layers of reinforcement. The results show, concrete with anode applied at one surface is only able to protect top two reinforcement layers with current density of 40 mA/m2, compared to anode at two adjacent concrete surfaces which protect all four layers of reinforcement with minimum 10 mA/m2 of current density. 80–90% of protection current reached the top layer of steel near the anode. Bottom layers of reinforcement received very minimal current and thus shows negligible protection. A drastic drop in protection was observed on moving down the reinforcement layers. Moreover, protection provided is highly depended on concrete resistivity.',\n",

This commissioned study aimed to explore use of maternal mental health (MMH) films within the UK charity, Best Beginnings’ Baby Buddy App alongside analysis of in-app activity data.\\n\\nMethods: Pregnant women using the Baby Buddy App were asked to view their choice of MMH films. Eighteen participants were recruited and offered a telephone or focus group interview, which were recorded, transcribed and data was analysed thematically.\\n\\nResults: The maternal interviews highlighted four main themes: Access to essential knowledge, Experiences of mental health, Emotional changes in pregnancy and early motherhood, and Barriers to engagement. Overall, women did not seek information about MMH from HCPs, apps or websites, suggesting they learned about MMH issues from others or past experiences. Findings were validated by the in-app data which highlighted MMH films accounted for 4.4% of all films accessed.\\n\\nConclusions: Some women were reluctant to identify a need for MMH knowledge, possibly due to stigma associated with MMH. The development of communication which aims to normalise emotional and mental health experiences (such as Best Beginnings ‘Out of the Blue’ films), may reduce stigma, and learning can take place.\\n\\nConflict of interest: This study was commissioned by Best Beginnings with funding from the Burdett Trust\\n\\nEthics: Approval was obtained via IRAS (167156) and CU Ethics (P45795)',\n",

A three-phased approach assessed: i) the metric accuracy of the 3D prints; ii) the viability of applying age and sex estimation methods (with multiple observers (n = 8); and, iii) the surface quality using a customized scoring method (with multiple observers (n = 8)). The results confirmed that the prints in this study were accurate to within 2.0 mm of the original dry bone. Observers were able to confidently assess the gross features of the prints; however fine surface details were not always well represented compared to the dry bones.

The aim of the current paper is to present the results of the DG SANCO-funded PROMISE project concerning the development of European guidelines for training social and health care professionals in mental health promotion.\\n\\nMethods\\nThe PROMISE project brought together a multidisciplinary scientific committee from eight European sites representing a variety of institutions including universities, mental health service providers and public health organisations. The committee used thematic content analysis to filter and analyse European and international policy documents, scientific literature reviews on mental health promotion and existing mental health promotion programmes with regard to identifying quality criteria for training care professionals on this subject. The resulting PROMISE Guidelines quality criteria were then subjected to an iterative feedback procedure with local steering groups and training professionals at all sites with the aim of developing resource kits and evaluation tools for using the PROMISE Guidelines. Scientific committees also collected information from European, national and local stakeholder groups and professional organisations on existing training programmes, policies and projects.\\n\\nResults\\nThe process identified ten quality criteria for training care professionals in mental health promotion: embracing the principle of positive mental health; empowering community stakeholders; adopting an interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach; including people with mental health problems; advocating; consulting the knowledge base; adapting interventions to local contexts; identifying and evaluating risks; using the media; evaluating training, implementation processes and outcomes. The iterative feedback process produced resource kits and evaluation checklists linked with each of these quality criteria in all PROMISE languages.\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe development of generic guidelines based on key quality criteria for training health and social care professionals in mental health promotion should contribute in a significant way to implementing policy in this important area.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction: In the United Kingdom (UK), 23,000 people annually are diagnosed with facial palsy (acute onset facial paralysis). For nearly one third this will result in a permanent disability, including in some the inability to smile. In addition to initial pharmacological therapy, guidelines recommend tailored facial exercise (TFE) therapy repeated every day. However, not all patients are currently able to access such specialist physical therapy. ‘Smart specs’ (using miniaturized sensors in the frames to measure facial movement) are currently being developed. Linked to a smartphone, these could allow people to practice TFEs discreetly, provide immediate feedback, and supply data on outcomes to the patient and their clinician.Methods: Modelling of introduction of Facial Remote Activity Monitoring Eyewear (FRAME) into treatment pathways for patients with facial palsy. This included: (i) review on effectiveness of TFE therapy; (ii) national surveys (medical staff, facial therapy specialists and patients) to gather data on access to TFE therapy; (iii) Delphi Exercise to identify consensus on key outcome measures; and, (iv) economic modelling to estimate cost-effectiveness and determine a range of acceptable costs for the technology. In parallel, research to examine target markets to inform product development, and production of integral commercialization plan. Results: Searches short-listed ten studies to add to the three included in the 2011 Cochrane review. Surveys indicate approximately thirteen percent of eligible UK patients access personalized TFE therapy. Estimated annual expenditure on hospital treatments for facial palsy patients is currently GBP >80 million (>USD 106 million) compared with <£0.5 million (<USD 0.66 million) on TFE therapy. Patients with permanent defects can suffer a loss of up to two quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).Conclusions: Findings from this study, particularly in relation to costs and benefits, will inform the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial. A novel wearable technology could make a major difference to people’s lives, as well as generating potential efficiencies for healthcare.',\n",

Our estimation results, based on the system-GMM method, show that used credit lines have a positive and significant impact on R&D investments. In addition, we find that this impact is more pronounced for small and young firms than for large and mature firms. These results show that firms use credit lines as part of their liquidity management tools for supporting their R&D investments. Finally, we provide evidence that European firms in bank-based countries increased their use of credit lines for financing their R&D investments during the financial crisis of 2007–2009, while the link between R&D investments and used credit lines became weaker during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010–2013.\",\n",

Several different treatments are available; including, among others, paracentesis plus fluid replacement, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, aldosterone antagonists, and loop diuretics. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy.\\nOBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for ascites according to their safety and efficacy.\\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until May 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and ascites.\\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and ascites. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.\\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.\\nMAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 49 randomised clinical trials (3521 participants) in the review. Forty-two trials (2870 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, without other features of decompensation, having mainly grade 3 (severe), recurrent, or refractory ascites. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 0.1 to 84 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Approximately 36.8% of participants who received paracentesis plus fluid replacement (reference group, the current standard treatment) died within 11 months. There was no evidence of differences in mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation in people receiving different interventions compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ascites at maximal follow-up was higher with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (HR 9.44; 95% CrI 1.93 to 62.68) and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (HR 30.63; 95% CrI 5.06 to 692.98) compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics had a higher rate of other decompensation events such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and variceal bleeding compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (rate ratio 2.04; 95% CrI 1.37 to 3.10) (very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials using paracentesis plus fluid replacement reported health-related quality of life or symptomatic recovery from ascites.\\nFUNDING: the source of funding for four trials were industries which would benefit from the results of the study; 24 trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 21 trials was unclear.\\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether interventions for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis decrease mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis and ascites. Based on very low-certainty evidence, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement may increase the resolution of ascites compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement. Based on very low-certainty evidence, aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics may increase the decompensation rate compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement.\",\n",

Finite element (FE) model is simulated in ABAQUS/CAE 6.7-6 using coupled temperature-displacement step at higher temperature considering material's property to be isotropic in nature. The effect of temperature on maximum flow stress and major strain at onset of necking is discussed. The true stress-strain behaviour and necking evolution through strain mapping are predicted from FE model and compared with the experimental results. The results show that with increase in temperature, the maximum flow stress decreases and necking delays with increase in limiting major strain for the Magnesium alloys. The work has been extended to predict the forming limit strains of Al 5086 alloy only on the negative minor strain region using M-K (Marciniak and Kuczynski) concept. An FE model based on M-K concept is simulated at 20 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C using coupled temperature-displacement step considering anisotropic sheet material. A groove is created in the middle of the model with an optimizedf value of 0.99, after much iteration. The forming limit strains from such FE simulations are compared with the available experimental data. The results are encouraging providing scope for further improvements in modelling.\",\n",

Achieving food and nutrition security is not only a rural challenge; the access to adequate (in terms of quantity and quality), healthy, nutritious and affordable food is also a growing concern for urban areas. The debate on the contribution of urban agriculture to food and nutrition security is however controversial. Based on a food systems approach, which includes the ‘farm-to-fork’ processes, pathways and dynamics between interlinked actors who are embedded in a spatial context, this research explores the potential of urban agriculture in two cities, Cape Town in South Africa and Maputo in Mozambique. First results of two baseline surveys amongst urban farmers in both cities, as well as qualitative in-depth interviews, show that urban farmers and home gardeners add nutrients and diversity to their diets, and can partly contribute to their income. Farmers value social benefits like urban greening, community building and empowerment. In Cape Town, main challenges are access to local and external markets, fair pricing and sovereignty in production. In Maputo, adaptation to more agroecological production techniques, combined with a more diverse production, could reduce farmers’ main challenges, such as pest pressure, and increase income and diversify diets. Foremost, urban agriculture needs to be embedded in the wider urban food system and urban planning in order to contribute towards more sustainable food systems.',\n",

This study looked at the geographical variations in rates of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19, exploring whether socioeconomic factors were linked to these variations. Methods A cross-sectional retrospective quantitative study was conducted using data regarding the number of cases of COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the pandemic in England (March-July 2020). A total of 242624 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from across England were analysed. The extent to which predisposing factors, such as population density, age and comorbities, affected morbidity and mortality rates in the different regions was calculated. The impact of socioeconomic factors, such as employment status and ethnicity, were also analysed. Results There was a significant association between long unemployment and likelihood of death from COVID-19. Areas with higher proportions of individuals from Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds were also more likely to have higher rates of hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19. Overall, London was the region with the highest standardised rates of hospitalisation (67.73%) and mortality (20%). Conclusions Socioeconomic factors have contributed to the geographical variations in COVID-19 mortality across different areas of England. This implies that these factors should be taken into account when planning healthcare and public health strategies.\",\n",

The presence of organic matter in soils can be very problematic especially during construction of infrastructures such as roads and foundations. Therefore, experimental and statistical investigations are crucial to further understand the effect of organic matter on swell and strength performance of soils treated with by-product materials (GGBS and CKD). Five artificially synthesised organic clays with 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% organic matters were mixed with 20% cement during the first phase of mixing. In the second phase, cement content was reduced to 4% and blended with 12% GGBS and 4% CKD respectively. All mixed samples were cured up to 56days and subjected to undrained triaxial test and one-dimensional oedometer swell test. The undrained shear strength of the untreated soils decreases from 22.47kPa to 15.6kPa upon increase in organic matter from 0-20%. While the swell increases from 1.17% to 3.83% for the same range of 0-20% organic matter. The results also show improvement on strength and swell upon addition of 20% cement for all investigated samples. For samples treated with 4% cement and inclusion of 12% GGBS and 4% CKD, the treated soils showed better performance in terms of swell potential due to reduction in plasticity compared to the plasticity of soils treated with 20% cement. Undrained shear strength increases from 632kPa to 804.9kPa and from 549.8kPa to 724.4kPa with reduction in organic matter upon addition of 20% CEM and 4% CEM: 12% GGBS: 4% CKD after 56days. The results obtained show that the inclusion of GGBS and CKD reduced swell and increases undrained shear strength irrespective of the percentage of organic materials due to cementation effect. However, results of the statistical studies show that the presence of organic matter influences the extent of performance of the cement, GGBS and CKD treated soils.',\n",

However, the way organisations adopt CRM in developing countries, and more specifically in the Arab world, might be different and the context certainly differs. There is a shortage of rigorous studies that examine the drivers of CRM adoption in this context. In this study, we examine the antecedents of CRM adoption in the Jordanian service sector. The conceptual framework of this research is tested using a cross-sectional survey of more than 322 practitioners. Using structural equation modelling analysis, results specify six underlying factors that explain CRM adoption: segmentation analysis, clear direction and objectives, performance measurement, rewarding usage, managing project changes, and knowledge management. Each area has implications for improving practices and maximising the benefits of adopting the process or management practice of CRM. This paper identifies key practices to provide useful guidelines for organisations in the Arab world making plans to adopt CRM, with broader implications for the adoption of many systems and projects there and for CRM deployment in developed regions.',\n",

Professional standards direct midwives to practise compassionately therefore the concept of compassionate midwifery exists, although this has yet to be explored as a concept in the UK or internationally. An understanding of what constitutes compassionate midwifery has the potential to increase midwifery knowledge and improve practice.DesignConcept Analysis.Data sourcesLiterature from 1990–2015 was searched using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ETHOS. Grey literature and examples of everyday usage of the concept were searched using Google.MethodsAn adapted model of evolutionary concept analysis.ResultsExplanations of compassionate midwifery were absent in the literature therefore the gathered data were evaluated in relation to elements of the compassion process: recognition of suffering, emotion, motivation and action. Compassionate midwifery is defined as the interrelations of authentic presence, noticing suffering, empathy, connectedness/relationship, emotion work, motivation to help/support, empowering women and alleviating suffering through negotiation, knowledge and skills. Antecedents and consequences were also identified and depicted in a schematic representation of the concept.ConclusionThis concept analysis provides a unique examination of compassionate midwifery and starting point for reflection on practice, education and further analysis. Empirical studies will provide the potential to take the process further by studying the experience of compassionate midwifery from different perspectives. A theory of compassionate midwifery will develop as new findings emerge.',\n",

Recent studies also show a glass-cliff effect where senior women can more easily fall from positions of leadership. Transplantation remains a male-dominated specialty. This study investigated gender and the perception of adverse clinical incidents in transplantation. METHODS: Prospective randomised web-based survey involving five clinical scenarios presenting two versions of episodes with errors or mistakes, with either a male or female as a randomly named protagonist (Set1 and Set2). To address unconscious bias, the study was described as examining actions following clinical adverse incidents in transplantation. Each scenario was followed by 2 closed questions: (1) clinical performance rating and (2) selection of action required. Reasoning was invited (open-text comments). Responses were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one invitees responded; 134 completed questionnaires. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in responses between sets for performance ratings or recommended actions. However, for \"first solo laparoscopic surgery\" scenario, there was some indication that \"No Action\" was more likely if surgeon was male (P = 0.056). Male responses rated female performance as significantly worse (P = 0.035) for the laboratory-based scenario. One hundred two participants provided open-text comments. Thematic analysis identified 7 themes. Acceptable levels of risk theme demonstrated engendered leadership beliefs, that is, when clinical judgment proved incorrect, males described as forceful but females as needing support. In cases where things went wrong, respondents were more likely to comment females should not have decided to proceed. CONCLUSIONS: While gender may no longer be an overt issue in perceived performance of senior staff in transplantation, respondents\\' use of language and their choice of words display elements of unconscious (covert) engendered views.',\n",

Antibiotics, in addition to supportive treatment (fluid and electrolyte balance, treatment of shock), form the mainstay treatments of SBP. Various antibiotics are available for the treatment of SBP, but there is uncertainty regarding the best antibiotic for SBP.\\nObjectives\\n\\nTo compare the benefits and harms of different antibiotic treatments for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\\nSearch methods\\n\\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on people with cirrhosis and SBP.\\nSelection criteria\\n\\nWe included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and SBP. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.\\nData collection and analysis\\n\\nTwo review authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of SBP, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available‐case analysis, according to the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit guidance.\\nMain results\\n\\nWe included a total of 12 trials (1278 participants; 13 antibiotics) in the review. Ten trials (893 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included patients having cirrhosis with or without other features of decompensation of varied aetiologies. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to three months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Only one trial was included under each comparison for most of the outcomes. Because of these reasons, there is very low certainty in all the results. The majority of the randomised clinical trials used third‐generation cephalosporins, such as intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ciprofloxacin as one of the interventions.\\n\\nOverall, approximately 75% of trial participants recovered from SBP and 25% of people died within three months. There was no evidence of difference in any of the outcomes for which network meta‐analysis was possible: mortality (9 trials; 653 participants), proportion of people with any adverse events (5 trials; 297 participants), resolution of SBP (as per standard definition, 9 trials; 873 participants), or other features of decompensation (6 trials; 535 participants). The effect estimates in the direct comparisons (when available) were very similar to those of network meta‐analysis. For the comparisons where network meta‐analysis was not possible, there was no evidence of difference in any of the outcomes (proportion of participants with serious adverse events, number of adverse events, and proportion of participants requiring liver transplantation). Due to the wide CrIs and the very low‐certainty evidence for all the outcomes, significant benefits or harms of antibiotics are possible.\\n\\nNone of the trials reported health‐related quality of life, number of serious adverse events, or symptomatic recovery from SBP.\\n\\nFunding: the source of funding for two trials were industrial organisations who would benefit from the results of the trial; the source of funding for the remaining 10 trials was unclear.\\nAuthors' conclusions\\n\\nShort‐term mortality after SBP is about 25%. There is significant uncertainty about which antibiotic therapy is better in people with SBP.\\n\\nWe need adequately powered randomised clinical trials, with adequate blinding, avoiding post‐randomisation dropouts (or performing intention‐to‐treat analysis), and using clinically important outcomes, such as mortality, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events.\",\n",

The data indicate that metric measurement and qualitative assessment of trauma macromorphology was possible from the 3D printed reconstructions. The findings also offer an indication that it is possible to obtain data around the accuracy of 3D printing bullet wounds and for establishing a bullet path. However, some limitations of prints reconstructed from post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) data were identified including the observation that not all fracture lines were successfully replicated which indicates that at present virtual models should be used concurrently with 3D prints in court.',\n",

The present article describes the role of the University of Primorska: adapting the guidelines with regard to SD prevention and developing and implementing a model training programme in SD prevention. Added value was supplied through collaboration with European level health and social service professional bodies, university networks, civil society organizations and non-traditional actors to identify the needs of organisations that provide training in MHP. The project also took into account different countries’ policy and legislation on MHP as well as best practice models; liaising with national governmental and non-governmental organisations working in the area of SD; developing effective working relationships with the local mental health service users and organisations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In-situ characterization techniques have been applied to elucidate the influence of γ/α transformation upon the extent of interphase precipitation in a low-carbon, vanadium-HSLA steel. Electron Back-scattered diffraction analyses of the γ/α orientation relationship with continuous cooling at 2 and 10 K/s suggest that the proportion of ferrite likely to hold interphase precipitation varies little with cooling rate. However, TEM analyses show that the interphase precipitation refines with increasing cooling rate in this cooling range. With cooling rates in excess of 20 K/s, interphase precipitation is increasingly suppressed due to the increasingly diffusional-displacive nature of the Widmanstätten γ/α transformation that is activated. The present study illustrates that the extent and dimensions of interphase precipitation can be controlled through controlled cooling.\\n\\nPublisher Statement: NOTICE: this is theauthor’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in MaterialsCharacterization.

This study assessed smallholder farmers’ perceptions of RE production in two villages in West Bengal, India. The availability and potential of renewable resources and livelihood characteristics of smallholders were explored. Relevant factors for the selection of appropriate RE technologies were identified, based on the participatory, bottom-up Integrated Renewable Energy Potential Assessment. The research area has abundant solar resources and substantial amounts of organic residues and waste suitable for biodigestion. Important factors\\nfor RE technology selection, as stated by farmers, are: ease of daily activities, government support, and limited land requirements. Solar-photovoltaic (PV) systems providing sufficient electricity for household use and irrigation are considered the most appropriate. Key informants focus on initial investment costs, government support, and reduced energy expenditure. They favor solar-PV systems for household electrification. Second choice was an integrated food and energy system that combines solar-PV for irrigation and vermicomposting of organic residues/wastes for fertilizer\\nproduction. Smallholder famers’ motivation to produce and use RE is high. Their perspective should be integrated in the design of RE-supporting policies and related programs to utilize local natural resources effectively and promote the transition towards renewable energy.',\n",

A typical 4-point laboratory setup loading system was modelled using an innovative and sustainable Finite Element Analysis (FEA) approach. In order to investigate the EC2 tension lap lengths (lo) design recommendation, a total of 100 analysis cases of lap lengths were considered for different reinforcement bar diameters of 10mm, 12mm, 16mm, 20mm and 25mm. The study has considered beam failure types, effects of failure load on the various lap length reduction cases and effects of steel reinforcement bar size changes on the design lap lengths. The analysis of results revealed that the yield strength of steel (fyk), diameter of tension reinforcement bar, (db), tensile strength of concrete (fctd) and concrete cover (cd) are the main parameters for a tension lap length design according to EC2. While a linear relationship exists between tension steel reinforcement bar sizes (db) and the obtained lap lengths (lo). The study reveals a potential use of 15% and 20% reduction in lap length (lo) for tension steel reinforcement bar sizes of 10mm, 16mm and 12mm and 20mm in comparison with the recommended design lap length of EC2. It was concluded that EC2 tension lap length design recommendation is conservative.',\n",

The association between autistic traits and lifetime suicidality was significantly mediated by camouflaging, defeat, and entrapment. After controlling for age, gender, current depression, and anxiety symptoms, defeat and entrapment (but not camouflaging) accounted for significantly more variance in lifetime suicidal thoughts. The interaction between camouflaging, defeat and entrapment predicted significantly less variance in lifetime suicidal thoughts than either variable alone. Conclusion: Results suggest that camouflaging autistic traits is a transdiagnostic risk factor for lifetime suicidality, relevant to the defeat and entrapment con-structs of the IMV model.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) has long been one of the most important algorithms within Symbolic Computation, as a tool to perform quantifier elimination in first order logic over the reals. More recently it is finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community as a tool to identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic.\\n\\nThe original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the truth of a formula containing those polynomials. One approach to achieve that coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs).\\n\\nThis paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all necessary background and the current state of the art. In particular, we present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over. We give a new complexity analysis to demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD reduces in line with the number of ECs. We show that the reduction can apply to both the number of polynomials produced and their degree.\",\n",

The texts had all been submitted as part of regular university coursework, and had been awarded top grades, indicating that they had met disciplinary requirements in terms of level and task. The corpus was compiled to enable identification of the linguistic and generic features associated with successful university student writing. Our detailed analyses of the corpus led to the identification of thirteen genre families, and supports the premises that university students write in a wider variety of genres than is commonly recognised, and that student writing differs across genres, disciplines and levels of university study. This review introduces the BAWE corpus and the associated genre family classification, then explains how they can be accessed and used for teaching and research purposes, how they have been used to deepen our understanding of academic writing in English, and where they have been used to inform the development of online, interactive and paper-based English language teaching materials.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper examines dividend changes in an emerging market: Thailand. We begin by considering the possible effects of the Thai corporate environment on dividend policy. We develop a theoretical model that considers the relationship between the strength of investor power and dividends in an agency cost/free cashflow framework. This allows us to consider the conditions for the outcome (positive relationship) or substitute (negative relationship) models, as discussed by La Porta et al. (2000). Our model also allows us to consider the expropriation hypothesis, in which the presence of large controlling shareholders may actually reduce outside investor power, leading to lower dividends. We then turn to our empirical analysis. Employing a large sample of companies that changed dividends in Thailand during the period 1996–2009, we test for the signaling, free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. A further contribution of our analysis is that we consider the impact of investor power and ownership on dividends in Thailand. Overall, we find little support for the signaling hypothesis, but we find considerable support for the free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. Our analysis of ownership variables suggests that increasing investor power (for example, high ownership concentration together with the presence of domestic institutional ownership) results in higher dividends, in support of the outcome model, rather than the substitution or expropriation models.',\n",

A number of relationships (based on the JMAK equations) for the rate of recrystallisation, with a range of Avrami parameter values, have been reported. This paper discusses the role of grain size distribution on the recrystallisation rates and Avrami values for an austenitic model steel (Fe-30 Ni). Cold deformation has been used to provide uniform macroscopic strain distributions (strains of 0.2 and 0.3, which are equivalent to 0.27 and 0.45 strain if deformed at 850°C), followed by recrystallisation during annealing at 850 – 950°C. It is shown that the Avrami parameter is directly related to the grain size distribution, with a lower Avrami exponent being seen for a larger average and wider grain size distribution. In-situ heating in an SEM with EBSD has shown the recrystallisation kinetics to be affected by both nucleation site and local strain heterogeneity.',\n",

Design Discrete choice experiment (DCE) with sequential mixed methods design. A staged approach to selection of attributes/levels included two literature reviews, focus groups with young people aged 16-24 years (n=21), experts' review (n=13) and narrative synthesis. Cognitive testing was undertaken to pilot and adapt the initial questionnaire. Online national panel was used for final DCE survey to maximise generalisability. Analysis of questionnaire responses used multinomial logit models and included validity checks. Setting England. Participants 1230 young people aged 16-24 from a national online panel (completion rate 73%). Outcome measures ORs for service attributes in relation to reference levels. Results The strongest attribute influencing preferences was chlamydia test accuracy (OR 3.24, 95% CI 3.13 to 3.36), followed by time to result (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.71 to 1.91). Respondents showed a preference for remote chlamydia testing options (self-testing, self-sampling and postal testing) over attendance at a testing location. For accessing treatment following a positive test result, there was a general preference for online (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.28) versus traditional general practitioner (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.24) or pharmacy (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.22) over clinic services. For accessing a healthcare professional and receipt of antibiotics, there was little difference in preferences between options. Conclusions Both test accuracy and very short intervals between testing and results were important factors for young people when deciding whether to undergo a routine test for asymptomatic chlamydia, with test accuracy being more important. These findings should assist technology developers, policymakers, commissioners and service providers to optimise technology adoption in service redesign, although use of an online panel may limit generalisability of findings to other populations.\",\n",

It finds that most students see their universities as relatively faith-friendly. Provision of campus-based religious activities and freedom of, and respect for, religious expression are important to students. Students who thought their faith was viewed with hostility described the classroom and organised student social activities as areas of tension. Institutional ethos influences Christian students’ perceptions: Christian students view Christian-foundation universities as the most friendly to faith, and the modern ‘post-1992’ universities as the least friendly.',\n",

Using the notebook affords a relationship with a set of external objects inscribed ‘on the page’ in the form of drawn sketches, notations and diagrams combined with text (Blackwell, deLahunta, McGregor, & Warwicker, 2004). This relationship can be described in cognitive terms; e.g. where the page becomes a surrogate for working memory or as a way for seeing something new by modelling structures or processes. The notebook in this sense becomes a site for the encounter of cognition and creativity; providing a place for thinking generatively with external objects (sketches, notations, etc.), an idea this essay will revisit (Blackwell et al., 2004, p. 70). This concept that the choreographer’s notebook affords a relationship with objects on the page, underpins the current development of the Choreographic Language Agent (CLA), as an extended interactive digital notebook',\n",

Alternatively, corrosion rate monitoring can assess the adequacy of CP. This work examines the possibility of predicting the corrosion rate of steel in concrete using polarization data induced by known applied current density using Butler Volmer equation. For this, the value of cathodic Tafel slope (βc) plays an important role; decreasing βc from 210 to 60mV, decreases the corrosion rate by 92% at 20mA/m2 current density.\\nThe adequacy of the proposed method is evaluated by applying Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) to concrete specimens which have a zinc rich paint (ZRP) as an external anode for a short duration of time. Results showed that to achieve at least 100mV of depolarization, the applied current density should be at least 7 times the corrosion rate for the ZRP anode. However, this holds true, considering the short duration of the tests. Prediction of the corrosion rate of steel from potential shift forms the basis for the improved CP performance criterion for reinforced concrete structures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Preterm birth is a major global health challenge, the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, and a key measure of a population's general health and nutritional status. Current clinical methods of estimating fetal gestational age are often inaccurate. For example, between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, the width of the 95% prediction interval around the actual gestational age is estimated to be 18–36 days, even when the best ultrasound estimates are used. The aims of this study are to improve estimates of fetal gestational age and provide personalised predictions of future growth. Methods: Using ultrasound-derived, fetal biometric data, we developed a machine learning approach to accurately estimate gestational age. The accuracy of the method is determined by reference to exactly known facts pertaining to each fetus—specifically, intervals between ultrasound visits—rather than the date of the mother's last menstrual period. The data stem from a sample of healthy, well-nourished participants in a large, multicentre, population-based study, the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century (INTERGROWTH-21st). The generalisability of the algorithm is shown with data from a different and more heterogeneous population (INTERBIO-21st Fetal Study). Findings: In the context of two large datasets, we estimated gestational age between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation with 95% confidence to within 3 days, using measurements made in a 10-week window spanning the second and third trimesters. Fetal gestational age can thus be estimated in the 20–30 weeks gestational age window with a prediction interval 3–5 times better than with any previous algorithm. This will enable improved management of individual pregnancies. 6-week forecasts of the growth trajectory for a given fetus are accurate to within 7 days. This will help identify at-risk fetuses more accurately than currently possible. At population level, the higher accuracy is expected to improve fetal growth charts and population health assessments. Interpretation: Machine learning can circumvent long-standing limitations in determining fetal gestational age and future growth trajectory, without recourse to often inaccurately known information, such as the date of the mother's last menstrual period. Using this algorithm in clinical practice could facilitate the management of individual pregnancies and improve population-level health. Upon publication of this study, the algorithm for gestational age estimates will be provided for research purposes free of charge via a web portal.

Yet, discourses of sexual diversity themselves sometimes entail normative and exclusive mechanisms. Using the concept of disidentification, this paper engages with counter-narratives from civil society actors supporting sexual and ethnic diversity in the Netherlands and Flanders that are critical of a dominant framework of “proper gayness.” This framework prescribes a self-centred, coming-out logic that neglects and forecloses subjectivities that entail religiosity, commitment to ethnic community and queerness simultaneously. We coin ethnosexual subjectivity to analyse these civil society actor’s critical, creative and sometimes affirmative accounts of queerness through inhabiting complex positions, and utilise the notions of space, specificity, and diversity. As co-producers of knowledge about sexual diversity, these actors employ the notions of “coming-in,” “multiple-identification,” and “self-acceptance” as a way to broaden the available space for sexual diversity, while being partly implicated in stigmatising politics of cultural and ethnic difference.',\n",

Using a collaborative mixed‐methods research with an international humanitarian organization, this paper sheds light on the causes of unsustainable operations in HSCs and investigates the impact of regional hubs on the environmental sustainability. First, an in‐depth focus group was conducted involving the organization's employees and the research team to identify the main causes contributing to unsustainable HSC in the organization. Five categories of causes were identified, namely, supply chain configuration (SCC), transportation, donors, material and waste, and humanitarian specificities. Then, based on respondents' prioritization, SCC was selected as the most important category. Carbon footprinting for three SCC scenarios was conducted: the current SCC and two conceptual SCC with two hubs in East and West Africa with different replenishment windows. The results reveal that the SCCs with hubs outperform the current SCC in terms of carbon footprint. Finally, the challenges of implementing the conceptual SCCs and possible solutions to address them were discussed through follow‐up individual interviews.\",\n",

We investigate whether FDI spillovers influence different phases of innovation process (from decision to innovate to productivity) among knowledge using and knowledge creating firms in an emerging European economy. The results show that innovation process in emerging economies is closer to imitation than creation of novel products. Local firms benefit from foreign counterparts in the early phase of innovation process.

By reorganising the material basis of the food system in the image of nature, the agroecological practices highlighted in this paper are generative of dietary diversity. However, although agroecology can increase the availability and quality of and access to dietary diversity for healthy nutrition, it should not be seen as a ‘technical fix’ by policymakers. Diversity on the farm does not automatically lead to diversity on the plate. More than agroecology, alone, is required to ensure fair access to dietary diversity in society. Gender- equitable rights of access and use of land, trees and their products, water and seeds, as well as socially inclusive forms of economic exchange, are all needed in addition to shifts in the balance of power and entitlements to realise the right to food and nutrition for all',\n",

Network analysis explored whether (i) being autistic is a risk marker for suicide; and (ii) pathways to suicidal thoughts are consistent for autistic and non-autistic adults.\\n\\nResults\\nBeing autistic connected closely with feeling like an outsider, anxiety and movement, which connected to suicidal thoughts through somatic experiences, low mood and burdensomeness. Networks were largely consistent for autistic and non-autistic people but connections from mood symptoms to somatic and thwarted belonging experiences were absent for autistic adults.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAutistic people experience more life stressors than non-autistic people leading to reduced coping, low mood and suicidal thoughts. Promoting belonging, reducing anxiety and understanding the role of movement could inform suicide prevention for autistic people.

This applies not only to the development of ideas and theories in argumentative texts, but also to the contrasting of new findings with old in experimental reports. Contrast, then, is central to the development of academic knowledge. A common finding in contrastive analyses is that the transition however is used significantly more by English than Chinese writers. This has been explained through suggestions that Chinese writers may be culturally less willing or linguistically less able to express contrast. Our objective was to identify which transitions of contrast are used more by Chinese students and to understand where and how they are used. In the closely matched Han CH-EN corpus of similar texts written by successful Chinese and English students at British universities, we identified four transitions that are used significantly more (p<0.05) by Chinese writers: while, whereas, on the other hand, and in contrast. Through examining contexts of use and specific examples, we argue that Chinese students employ a greater variety of transitions than English students to achieve a similar amount of contrast in their writing.

We found that ethnic networks have a positive impact overall on trade, confirming the results of previous studies. However, the magnitude of the positive effect varies across different ethnicities along two dimensions. First, the strength of family ties in the culture of origin accelerates the pro-trade effect of its ethnic networks, suggesting ethnicities with stronger family ties have a cultural preference for trading within their own ethnic community. In comparison, ethnic diversity weakens the positive effect of ethnic networks on trade, suggesting an informational value of diverse ethnic structure in promoting trade between different ethnicities.

       "  'abstract': 'In 1997 Wang and Burris published a seminal paper in which they elucidated a visual research methodology, which has become widely known as ‘photovoice’. The qualitative method they outlined proposed that cameras should be given to people so that they could document their realities, engage in critical reflection, and advocate for change (Wang, 1999; Wang and Redwood-Jones, 2001). In their initial project with women in the Yunnan counties of Chenjang and Luliang in China, Wang and Burris argued that photographs could become powerful tools ‘to furnish evidence and to promote an effective, participatory means of sharing expertise and knowledge’ which could be utilised as potential catalysts for change within communities (1997:369). They distinguished this method from ‘photo novella’ and ‘photonovel’, which they had previously used to describe processes of using photographs or images in storytelling and educational literacy, and instead defined photovoice by its orientation to social change and critical dialogue with policymakers or those in positions of power (Wang et al., 1996; Wang and Burris, 1994). Photovoice, they suggested, was significantly different from ‘photo novella’ and enabled people to ‘identify, represent, and enhance their community through a specific photographic technique’ (Wang and Burris, 1997:369). In the article, they outlined the three main goals of photovoice: 1) to enable people to record and reflect their community’s strengths and concerns, 2) to promote critical dialogue and knowledge about important community issues through large and small group discussion of photographs, 3) to reach policymakers (Wang and Burris, 1997:370).\\n\\nSince Wang and Burris’ original paper (1997), photovoice has been adapted and evolved, and a considerable amount of researchers and practitioners have sought to make use of photovoice’s specific potential to develop insights into the everyday lives and experiences of people sometimes described as ‘seldom heard’, ‘hard to reach’, and ‘marginalised’. This is with the intention of ‘giving voice’ to people and specific communities, challenging prevailing representations, and exploring ‘hidden’ lives. A rather smaller literature explores and critiques the inherent promise of emancipation within photovoice, whilst raising concern about the latent potential for its use in surveillance and embedding negative representations of particular people and communities (Prins, 2010).\\n\\nIn this chapter, we describe the theoretical underpinnings of photovoice before outlining how to undertake a photovoice project, contextualising this within a broader discussion of how photovoice has been used and applied by researchers, practitioners and communities. We also highlight key strengths, challenges, limitations and debates by drawing together discussions in the literature, as well as revisiting Wang and Burris’s detailed explanations of photovoice and the contemporary literature from a range of disciplinary traditions. This chapter is written from the perspective that a researcher will be involved in facilitating the photovoice project, rather than the project being led by a practitioner or community facilitator.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the advancement of solid-state devices for lighting, illumination is on the verge of being completely restructured. This revolution comes with numerous advantages and viable opportunities that can transform the world of wireless communications for the better. Solid-state LEDs are rapidly replacing the contemporary incandescent and fluorescent lamps. In addition to their high energy efficiency, LEDs are desirable for their low heat generation, long lifespan, and their capability to switch on and off at an extremely high rate. The ability of switching between different levels of luminous intensity at such a rate has enabled the inception of a new communication technology referred to as visible light communication (VLC). With this technology, the LED lamps are additionally being used for data transmission. This paper provides a tutorial and a survey of VLC in terms of the design, development, and evaluation techniques as well as current challenges and their envisioned solutions. The focus of this paper is mainly directed towards an indoor setup. An overview of VLC, theory of illumination, system receivers, system architecture, and ongoing developments are provided. We further provide some baseline simulation results to give a technical background on the performance of VLC systems. Moreover, we provide the potential of incorporating VLC techniques in the current and upcoming technologies such as fifth-generation (5G), beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless communication trends including sixth-generation (6G), and intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) among others.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction\\nTreatment adherence in kidney transplant patients is particularly challenging during adolescence and young adulthood. This produces adverse consequences such as higher transplant failure, decreased quality of life and increased mortality. A novel qualitative creative problem-solving method (KJ Ho), widely used in Japan, has been applied in the United Kingdom (UK) to disentangle clinicians’ and young kidney transplant patients’ perspectives on this problem area. The study forms the first stage in the development of a user-driven digital intervention to improve long-term treatment adherence. KJ-Ho has contributed widely to clinical practice and knowledge in multiple contexts in Japan; our first application of this method in the UK should similarly contribute to improving post-transplant practice and knowledge.\\n\\nMethods\\nKJ Ho is a Japanese creative problem solving method to organize qualitative research data. Clinicians were invited to take part in a two hour creative workshop. Data were analysed in a step-wise approach from which several overarching themes emerged. Similar workshops for patients (aged from 13 – 30 years) and their family members are being conducted. KJ Ho findings will be synthesized with two systematic literature reviews being undertaken in parallel.\\n\\nResults\\nSix overarching themes were identified during the clinicians’ workshop: (1) non-adherence; (2) communication; (3) continuity in care; (4) values; (5) family; (6) patient-centred. Similar data concerning young kidney transplant patients’ needs is currently being collected and analysed. Triangulation of the KJ Ho data with standard systematic review outputs will provide a robust evidence base for intervention development.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nIntegration of this original KJ Ho problem-solving method with standard Western systematic literature review methods can better identify factors currently influencing treatment adherence. This co-creation phase will be followed by a co-design stage to produce a digital intervention able to improve treatment adherence among young kidney transplant patients, which will be tested in a future large-scale trial.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Direct hot press forming of Zn-coated 22MnB5 steels is impeded by micro-cracks that occur in the substrate due to the presence of Zn during the forming process. A study was therefore undertaken to quantify concentration of Zn across the α-Fe(Zn) coating and on grain boundaries in the α-Fe(Zn) layer and the underlying γ-Fe(Zn) substrate after isothermal annealing of Zn-coated 22MnB5 at 1173 K (900 °C) and to link the Zn distribution to the amount and type of micro-cracks observed in deformed samples. Finite difference model was developed to describe Zn diffusion and the growth of the α-Fe(Zn) layer. The penetration of Zn into the γ-Fe(Zn) substrate after 600 seconds annealing at 1173 K (900 °C) through bulk diffusion is estimated to be 3 μm, and the diffusion depth of Zn on the γ-Fe(Zn) grain boundaries is estimated to be 6 μm, which is significantly shorter than the maximum length (15 to 50 μm) of the micro-cracks formed in the severely stressed conditions, indicating that the Zn diffusion into the γ-Fe(Zn) from the α-Fe(Zn) during annealing is not correlated to the depth of micro-cracks. On the other hand, the maximum amount of Zn present in α-Fe(Zn) layer decreases with annealing time as the layer grows and Zn oxidizes, and the amount of Zn-enriched areas inside the α-Fe(Zn) layer is reduced leading to reduced length of cracking. Solid-Metal-Induced Embrittlement mechanism is proposed to explain the benefit of extended annealing on reduced depth of micro-crack penetration into the γ-Fe(Zn) substrate.\\nPublisher Statement: The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-015-3203-y',\n",

The conditions of children and young people who require such feeding are diverse but could relate to problems with swallowing (dysphagia), digestive disorders or neurological/muscular disorders. However, the use of a blended diet as an alternative to prescribed formula feeds for children fed via a gastrostomy is a contentious issue for clinicians and researchers. From a rapid review of the literature, we identify that current evidence falls into three categories: (1) those who feel that the use of a blended diet is unsafe and substandard; (2) those who see benefits of such a diet as an alternative in particular circumstances (eg, to reduce constipation) and (3) those who see merit in the blended diet but are cautious to proclaim potential benefits due to the lack of clinical research. There may be some benefits to using blended diets, although concerns around safety, nutrition and practical issues remain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There has been a rapid development and utilization of three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies in engineering, health care, and dentistry. Like many technologies in overlapping disciplines, these techniques have proved to be useful and hence incorporated into the forensic sciences. Therefore, this paper describes how the potential of using 3D printing is being recognized within the various sub-disciplines of forensic science and suggests areas for future applications. For instance, the application can create a permanent record of an object or scene that can be used as demonstrative evidence, preserving the integrity of the actual object or scene. Likewise, 3D printing can help with the visualization of evidential spatial relationships within a scene and increase the understanding of complex terminology within a courtroom. However, while the application of 3D printing to forensic science is beneficial, currently there is limited research demonstrated in the literature and a lack of reporting skewing the visibility of the applications. Therefore, this article highlights the need to create good practice for 3D printing across the forensic science process, the need to develop accurate and admissible 3D printed models while exploring the techniques, accuracy and bias within the courtroom, and calls for the alignment of future research and agendas perhaps in the form of a specialist working group.',\n",

It is essential for such organizations to identify the main agility indicators that contribute to their strategic core. The purpose of this paper is to propose and test a systematic methodology that identifies key agility indicators through prioritization and establishing the intra- and inter-relationships among them. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology consists of four phases. Phase I forms a pool of agility key performance indicators (KPIs). Phase II categorizes and ranks the KPIs based on their importance and the gap that exists between their current and desired level. Using interpretive structural modeling, phase III establishes the intra-relationships among the KPIs as well as agility attributes, agility enablers and improvement paths, collectively referred to as agility indicators. Finally, phase IV analyzes the inter-relationships among agility indicators using three consecutive houses of quality. Findings: To demonstrate the capability of the proposed methodology, it was applied to a dairy food company operating in a competitive environment. The application could address the shortcomings of previous agility methodologies and helped the company to assign resources to the right agility indicators with the highest influence on strategic agility. Research limitations/implications: The methodology was applied to a single organization only. The application does not include long-term post-implementation observations and measurement of strategic agility. Practical implications: Practitioners can benefit from the methodology to identify the right agility indicators of their organization and assign organizational resources for the improvement of such indicators. The methodology ensures selecting indicators that contribute to organization’s strategic agility, although ostensibly seem unrelated. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature of strategic and organizational agility by proposing a systematic methodology that considers both intra- and inter-relationships among agility indicators. The methodology also makes a decent contribution in addressing organizational ambidexterity by analyzing mutually exclusive indicators pertaining to current and future opportunities for the organization.',\n",

We describe multiple approaches to address the problem using tools from Symbolic Computation. We describe how progress was made to achieve semi-algebraic descriptions of the multistationarity regions of parameter space, and compare symbolic and numerical methods. The biological networks studied are models of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) network which has already consumed considerable effort using special insights into its structure of corresponding models. Our main example is a model with 11 equations in 11 variables and 19 parameters, 3 of which are of interest for symbolic treatment. The model also imposes positivity conditions on all variables and parameters. We apply combinations of symbolic computation methods designed for mixed equality / inequality systems, specifically virtual substitution, lazy real triangularization and cylindrical algebraic decomposition, as well as a simplification technique adapted from Gaussian elimination and graph theory. We are able to determine semi-algebraic conditions for multistationarity of our main example over a 2-dimensional parameter space. We also study a second MAPK model and a symbolic grid sampling technique which can locate such regions in 3-dimensional parameter space.',\n",

One line of evidence that is emerging as a possible risk factor in the occurrence of VHs is the sleep–wake cycle and sleep behavior in patients with PD. This study compared sleep patterns in a group of visually hallucinating Parkinson's patients with a group of nonhallucinating PD patients and an age-matched control group. Nocturnal sleep was assessed by actigraphy and diaries, while daytime sleepiness and function were assessed by a battery of self-rating sleep questionnaires. Compared with the control group both patient groups had more sleep-related problems and significantly altered sleep patterns, as measured by both actigraphy and sleep questionnaires. Patients who hallucinated however slept less than nonhallucinating patients and also had increased awakenings after sleep onset, reduced sleep efficiency, and increased daytime sleepiness. We propose that VHs in some PD patients may be a symptom of poor sleep and prolonged daytime sleepiness, suggesting that arousal may play a role in the genesis of the hallucination phenomenon.\",\n",

After controlling for publication selection and sources of heterogeneity, we find that both tax credits and subsidies induce additional private R&D and that neither instrument systematically outperforms the other. However, whereas subsidy effects are increasing over time tax credit effects are not. Although their respective effects are “small”, they are not negligible: in round terms, an additional $1 of public R&D support of either type induces 7.5 cents of additional private R&D expenditure. Sources of heterogeneity in the reported effects include: tax credits are most effectively delivered as “incremental” schemes, are more effective in economies with a balanced “policy-mix” regime, and are generally less effective for micro firms and SMEs than for large firms; while subsidies are more effective for manufacturing firms, although not for high-tech firms, and are more effective than tax credits in economies predominantly using subsidies.

Additionally, ethical investors need to focus on net zero carbon emissions as a factor in investment selection to stimulate companies to adopt appropriate strategies. They can also support firms developing new internet of things technologies in these areas. Companies need to develop policies supporting the adoption of zero net carbon emissions and related internet of things targets. This development to ethical and sustainable investment will require the involvement of investors, wealth managers, and fund providers.

The non-alcohol-related liver and gallbladder disorders priority setting partnership was established to identify the top research priorities in the prevention, diagnostic and treatment of gallbladder disorders and liver disorders not covered by the James Lind Alliance (JLA) alcohol-related liver disease priority setting partnership.\\nDesign The methods broadly followed the principles of the JLA guidebook. The one major deviation from the JLA methodology was the final step of identifying priorities: instead of prioritisation by group discussions at a consensus workshop involving stakeholders, the prioritisation was achieved by a modified Delphi consensus process.\\nResults A total of 428 unique valid diagnostic or treatment research questions were identified. A literature review established that none of these questions were considered ‘answered’ that is, high-quality systematic reviews suggest that further research is not required on the topic. The Delphi panel achieved consensus (at least 80% Delphi panel members agreed) that a research question was a top research priority for six questions.

       "  'abstract': \"Financial and industrial economists have increasingly recognized the interaction between product market competition and financing decisions of firms. This paper analyzes the relationship between product market competition (measured by Tobin's Q) and the capital structure of Chinese listed firms in a static and dynamic setting. We study an unbalanced panel dataset of 10,416 firm-year observations in 12 industries from 1994 to 2006. Employing several empirical methods, this study finds that there are significant differences in the debt ratios and product market competition across different industries. Our results suggest that the relationship between leverage and product market competition is non-linear (parabolic or cubic), depending on industry type, company size and firms' growth opportunities. The system-GMM results reveal that Chinese firms tend to adjust their leverage ratios through time. Overall, the fixed effects and GMM estimates detect a linear and inverse relationship between the intensity of competition and leverage ratio, which supports the predation theory.\",\n",

It is unclear whether self-report suicide scales that have been designed for non-autistic people accurately measure suicide risk constructs in autistic people. Therefore, this study explored, for the first time, whether the measurement properties of the self-report scales of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide are equivalent in autistic and non-autistic adults.\\n\\nMethods: In this study, responses from 342 autistic and 353 non-autistic people on the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire-10 (INQ-10) and Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale–Fearlessness about Death (ACSS–FAD) were compared by using measurement invariance analysis. Data were gathered through an online cross-sectional survey of the self-report measures.\\n\\nResults: Results suggest that measurement properties of the INQ-10 were different in autistic people. Autistic characteristics, such as different theory of mind and preference for concrete language, may have led the scale items to load differently on the factors in the autistic group than in the non-autistic group. The measurement properties of the ACSS–FAD were invariant between autistic and non-autistic people.\\n\\nConclusions: Scores on the INQ-10 cannot be meaningfully compared between autistic and non-autistic people due to different measurement properties. Future research could explore how autistic people experience the concepts of burdensomeness and belonging, to consider how measures could accurately capture this. This would allow researchers to explore the role of these constructs in the development of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in autistic people. Clinicians should be aware that suicide risk factors may present differently in autistic people. Scores on the ACSS-FAD can be meaningfully compared, but the negatively worded scale items may pose similar response difficulties to autistic and non-autistic people.',\n",

The conceptual framework consists of the six constructs: collectivism/individualism, brand reputation, self-congruence, brand affect, brand identification and brand loyalty. Twelve hypotheses were developed and tested. Data were collected from consumers who had experienced well-known global chain restaurant brands. The three models were tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling.\\nFindings: Findings highlight the important mediating role of brand affect in symbolic consumption, which previously has not been revealed empirically. Moreover, it is found that self-congruence does not mediate the relationship between brand reputation, collectivism/individualism and brand affect, despite its prominence in previous symbolic consumption studies. In the status and social needs models, brand reputation mediates between collectivism/individualism and self-congruence, brand identification, brand affect and brand loyalty.\\nOriginality/value: This is the first empirical paper to investigate symbolic consumption in the context of three types of models, according to symbolic needs, in the context of restaurant consumption. The study also identifies the major components of the consumer’s symbolic needs based on the attributes of symbolic consumption. Moreover, this study reveals that when both social needs and status needs are mixed, a hierarchy exists between consumers’ symbolic needs. Finally, the study makes an important contribution to the literature by applying the concept of brand affect to symbolic consumption research and exploring the relationships between the external motivational factors and the internal elements of symbolic consumption.',\n",

A literature review was carried out which revealed limited understanding of the end of life needs of this patient group. The role of clinical staff was highlighted as a key factor, yet their views were not reflected in the published research. Aims The aim of this research was to conduct an exploratory study to develop further understanding of how to improve end of life care for people with severe mental illness through exploring the views and experiences of clinical staff working in both mental health and end of life services. Methods Four focus groups with clinicians were conducted, using the CUbe method (Magee, Fielden, & Moody, 2015), across a large Mental Health Trust and a hospice. 23 participants from a range of professional backgrounds attended and shared their experiences and perceptions of the barriers to delivering good end of life care to people with mental illnesses. The data was analysed using the Framework Method (Gale, Heath, Cameron, Rashid, & Redwood, 2013) and themes and explanatory concepts were drawn. Findings The findings of the study were clustered into five themes: Structure of The System, Presentation of the Patient, Confidence of the Clinician and the Problem of Partnership. Implications for practice were drawn from the themes which can be used to inform improvements to clinical practice. Conclusions The barriers to providing good end of life care were described within the literature, which largely originated outside the UK. The findings of the analysis found many similarities and some new findings. Recommendations were made which include improvements to partnership working, involvement of patients, carers and clinical staff in improving care and the need to develop the confidence and knowledge of clinicial staff from mental health and end of life services.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Inspired by its success in financial sectors, the blockchain technique is emerging as an enabling technology for secure distributed control and management of wireless networks. In order to fully benefit from this distributed ledger technology, its limitations, cost, complexity and empowerment also have to be critically appraised. Depending on the specific context of the problem to be solved, these limitations have been handled to some extent through a clear dichotomy in the blockchain architectures, namely by conceiving both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. Permissionless blockchain requires massive computing power to achieve consensus, while its permissioned counterpart is energy efficient but would require trusted participants. To combine these benefits by gaining trust at a high energy efficiency, a novel mechanism is proposed for automatically learning the trust level of users in a public blockchain network and granting them access to a private blockchain network. In this context, machine learning is a very powerful tool capable of automatically learning the trust level. We have proposed reinforcement learning for bridging the dichotomy of blockchains in terms of striking a trust vs complexity trade-off in an unknown environment. Benefits and limitations of various forms of blockchain techniques are analyzed, followed by their reinforcement-aided evolution. We demonstrate that the proposed reinforcement learning aided blockchain is capable of supporting high-integrity autonomous operation and decision making in wireless networks. The win-win amalgamation of these techniques has been demonstrated for striking a compelling balance between the benefits of permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks through the case-study of the proposed blockchain based unmanned aerial vehicle aided wireless networks.',\n",

In the present paper we both repeat our prior experiments on problems which have more variables (and thus exponentially more possible orderings), and examine the metric which our ML classifiers targets. The natural metric is computational runtime, with classifiers trained to pick the ordering which minimises this. However, this leads to the situation were models do not distinguish between any of the non-optimal orderings, whose runtimes may still vary dramatically. In this paper we investigate a modification to the cross-validation algorithms of the classifiers so that they do distinguish these cases, leading to improved results.',\n",

This method is tested to (1) establish if novice users can produce 3D crania models following the steps, and (2) determine if these models are accurate to models from experienced users.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\nThe step-by-step method was recorded and tested by five observers who each produced twenty 3D models using clinical sinus CT scans (n = 20). The models (n = 100) were evaluated through a quantitative mesh comparison to establish the accuracy with experienced users and against novice users.\\n\\nResults\\nThe mesh comparison between the models from the experienced observers resulted in an average absolute mean distance of 0.4 mm, with 99% of models accurate to within 0.5 mm. The novice observers were able to create robust 3D models following the step-by-step method with average absolute mean distances of 0.5 to 0.6 mm, and 95% of the mean distances within 1 mm of the reference model.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAll of the crania models produced were comparably accurate with minor variances seen in the background noise and orbital bone modelling.

For inclusion in the review, studies had to primarily relate to kidney disease and include results from statistical (econometric) analyses of respondents' choice or preference. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed against a range of systematic review criteria, and methods and results summarized. Results We identified 14 eligible studies from Europe, Australasia, North America and Asia, reporting preferences for treatment or screening, patient experiences, quality of life (QOL), health outcomes and priority-setting frameworks. Specific contexts included medical interventions in kidney transplantation and renal cell carcinoma, health policies for organ donation and allocation, dialysis modalities and end-of-life care, using a variety of statistical models. The characteristics of time' (i.e.Transplant waiting time, dialysis hours, transport time) and QOL (pre-and post-Transplant, or pre-and post-dialysis) consistently influenced patient and clinician preferences across the choice studies. Conclusions DCE are increasingly used to obtain information about key preferences in kidney transplantation and dialysis. These study methods provide quantitative information about respondents' trade-offs between conflicting clinical and policy objectives, and can establish how preferences vary among stakeholder groups.\",\n",

This paper draws upon contingency theory to synthesize green practices for HSCs, identify the contingency factors that impact on greening HSCs and explore how focal humanitarian organizations (HOs) can cope with such contingency factors. Design/methodology/approach: Deploying an action research methodology, two-and-a-half cycles of collaboration between researchers and a United Nations agency were completed. The first half-cycle developed a deductive greening framework, synthesizing extant green practices from the literature. In the second and third cycles, green practices were adopted/customized/developed reflecting organizational and contextual contingency factors. Action steps were implemented in the HSC for prophylactics, involving an operational mix of disaster relief and development programs. Findings: First, the study presents a greening framework that synthesizes extant green practices in a suitable form for HOs. Second, it identifies the contingency factors associated with greening HSCs regarding funding environment, stakeholders, field of activity and organizational management. Third, it outlines the mechanisms for coping with the contingency factors identified, inter alia, improving the visibility of headquarters over field operations, promoting collaboration and resource sharing with other HOs as well as among different implementing partners in each country, and working with suppliers for greener packaging. The study advances a set of actionable propositions for greening HSCs. Practical implications: Using an action research methodology, the study makes strong practical contributions. Humanitarian practitioners can adopt the greening framework and the lessons learnt from the implementation cycles presented in this study.

Design/methodology/approach: This study reviewed relevant literature of research work carried out by previous researchers, leading to a deeper understanding of the properties of both RA and RAC. The properties of RA and RAC reported in the various studies were then compared to their corresponding natural aggregate (NA) and natural aggregate concrete, as well as the specifications provided in different codes of practice. In addition, the mix design methods appropriate to RAC and the cost implication of using RA were reviewed. Findings: Findings show that the contribution of RA to strength appears inferior in comparison to NA. The shortcoming is attributed to the mortar attached to the RA, which raises its water absorption capacity and lowers its density relative to those of NA. However, it has been reported that the use of regulated quantity of RA, new mixing and proportioning methods, the addition of admixtures and strengthening materials such as steel fibres, can improve both mechanical and durability properties of RAC. Cost evaluation also showed that some savings can be realized by using RA instead of NA.

There is uncertainty over the best treatment regimen for hepatorenal syndrome.\\nObjectives\\n\\nTo compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for hepatorenal syndrome in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\\nSearch methods\\n\\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trial registers until December 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatorenal syndrome in people with cirrhosis.\\nSelection criteria\\n\\nWe included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.\\nData collection and analysis\\n\\nTwo authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of hepatorenal syndrome, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, hazard ratio (HR), and mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.\\nMain results\\n\\nWe included a total of 25 trials (1263 participants; 12 interventions) in the review. Twenty‐three trials (1185 participants) were included in one or more outcomes. All the trials were at high risk of bias, and all the evidence was of low or very low certainty. The trials included participants with liver cirrhosis of varied aetiologies as well as a mixture of type I hepatorenal syndrome only, type II hepatorenal syndrome only, or people with both type I and type II hepatorenal syndrome. Participant age ranged from 42 to 60 years, and the proportion of females ranged from 5.8% to 61.5% in the trials that reported this information. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. Overall, 59% of participants died during this period and about 35% of participants recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. The most common interventions compared were albumin plus terlipressin, albumin plus noradrenaline, and albumin alone.\\n\\nThere was no evidence of a difference in mortality (22 trials; 1153 participants) at maximal follow‐up between the different interventions. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. There was no evidence of differences in the proportion of people with serious adverse events (three trials; 428 participants), number of participants with serious adverse events per participant (two trials; 166 participants), proportion of participants with any adverse events (four trials; 402 participants), the proportion of people who underwent liver transplantation at maximal follow‐up (four trials; 342 participants), or other features of decompensation at maximal follow‐up (one trial; 466 participants). Five trials (293 participants) reported number of any adverse events, and five trials (219 participants) reported treatment costs. Albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer numbers of adverse events per participant (rate ratio 0.51, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.87). Eighteen trials (1047 participants) reported recovery from hepatorenal syndrome (as per definition of hepatorenal syndrome). In terms of recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, in the direct comparisons, albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome than albumin plus terlipressin (HR 0.04; 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.25 and HR 0.26, 95% CrI 0.07 to 0.80 respectively). There was no evidence of differences between the groups in any of the other direct comparisons. In the network meta‐analysis, albumin and albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin.\\n\\nFunding: two trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; five trials were funded by parties who had no vested interest in the results of the trial; and 18 trials did not report the source of funding.\\nAuthors' conclusions\\n\\nBased on very low‐certainty evidence, there is no evidence of benefit or harm of any of the interventions for hepatorenal syndrome with regards to the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events (proportion), number of serious adverse events per participant, any adverse events (proportion), liver transplantation, or other decompensation events. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer 'any adverse events per participant' than albumin plus terlipressin. Low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence also found that albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin.\\n\\nFuture randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered; employ blinding, avoid post‐randomisation dropouts or planned cross‐overs (or perform an intention‐to‐treat analysis); and report clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health‐related quality of life, adverse events, and recovery from hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin plus noradrenaline and albumin plus terlipressin appear to be the interventions that should be compared in future trials.\",\n",

This study used a qualitative approach with in-depth semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of 10 adult siblings of a baby diagnosed with Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) or Trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome). Findings illustrate that parental grief from the time of their child's diagnosis onward is also experienced by siblings. Although young adults may have conflicting feelings as a bereaved sibling, there is evidence that the experience impacts on their world views and their attitudes about prospective and expectant parenthood. The study highlights the importance of providing siblings with short-term and long-term support from the time of their brother's or their sister's diagnosis onward and provides new understanding about benefit of professional and peer support in helping young adults develop resilience and coping strategies.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite the overall positive feeling about Internet of Things’ (IoT) development, a main risk involves the integrity of the system itself. This paper considers the influence of the IoT on marketing practices and addresses the overlooked area of the dark side of the IoT. Dysfunctional forms of IoT have been neglected as an area of research, so identifying the different types of IoT providers’ dark-side behaviours will assist in the development of an integrated approach to the IoT that will help to overcome or mitigate these dark-side behaviours. Based on an extensive literature review, supplemented by expert insights drawn from the authors’ study of the IoT, a framework is developed that classifies the varying IoT dark-side behaviour types. The framework reveals eight forms of dark-side behaviour that are grouped into four broad categories. This classification illustrates how different types of dark-side behaviours are linked to key strategic IoT processes and also outlines how these dark-side practices may be addressed by adopting a more strategic and integrity-oriented approach. We conclude that with the adoption of a more holistic approach to the IoT, dark-side behaviours can be addressed and move in the direction of more effective marketing practices.

We argue that while the wave metaphor has been popular among feminists in many parts of Europe, it does not travel easily across national and regional borders, and should best be understood as a way of framing feminist practice, rather than referring to discreet cohorts of feminists. We can also discern a broader trend whereby preoccupations around the precise character of the feminist subject have given way to more diverse conceptions of feminist subjectivity in which the role of historically excluded constituencies within feminism – queers, lesibian, gay, bisexual and trans* women, black and minority ethnic women and indeed men – are, in some contexts, more visible. This is reflected in the practices of contemporary feminisms, in which the dominant approach is what we might call, following Bice Maiguashca, a ‘principled pragmatism’, characterized by a steadfast opposition to gender inequality alongside a degree of fluidity and flexibility in terms of the strategies and tactics used.',\n",

However, in the last decade, or so, there has been a huge growth in interest in the possibility of far greater use of magnesium in automobile construction, particularly in the form of high pressure die castings. This has been accompanied by dramatic increase in the volume of magnesium produced and changes in the location of magnesium extraction so that some 85% is now produced in China.

Objectives: This study aims to examine the usability and preliminary efficacy of an online Artificial Intelligence driven nutrition platform to support people with diabetes and their carers in identifying healthy recipes, meal planning, and online shopping. Methods: Diabetes UK signposted people with diabetes and their carers through their website, social media and newsletters. Seventy-three adult participants with (pre)diabetes or their carers, completed the baseline online survey, as did 23 of these after 8 weeks of platform use. Online semi-structured interviews were performed with platform users (n=7) who agreed to be followed-up and diabetes experts (n=3) who had nutrition and/or platform knowledge. The intervention consists of an online platform, incorporating Artificial Intelligence to personalize recipes, meal planning and shopping list experiences, and was made available for a period of 8 weeks. Baseline characteristics, satisfaction, system usability, and (diabetes-related) health indicators were assessed before and after 8 weeks of platform use. Results: Reductions in weight (MeanDiff: 4.5 kg/m2, 95% CI [1.0, 12.0], P=.009, Cliff's ∂ =0.33) and waist size (MeanDiff: 3.9 cm, 95% CI [2.0, 6.5], P=.008, Cliff's ∂ =0.48) were found. Most participants (60.6%) did not regularly use the platform and had low or very low engagement scores. However, the platform was perceived as accessible with no need for additional assistance (52%), user-friendly (38%), and easy to use (38%) regardless of some usability issues. Saving recipes was the most popular feature with a total of 663 saved recipes. Conclusions: This study indicated that the usability of the nutrition platform was well-perceived by its users and their carers. Because participants managed their diabetes well, adding in education would be specifically relevant for people less familiar with the role of diet in diabetes management. To assess the platform’s effectiveness in improving diabetes-related health indicators, controlled studies with a larger and more diverse participant sample, are recommended.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Turkish construction industry has achieved rapid growth since the 2000s. The sector plays a significant role for the national economy due to its contribution to job creation, industrialization and economic growth. However, the sector has been widely criticized because of heavy work conditions and high rates of work accidents. The construction industry generally grows faster than GDP in expansion periods and shrinks more during the crisis years. While these fluctuations make the construction industry more unstable, they also affect its employees more negatively than the general economic course during recessions in construction activities. Workplace health and safety standards do not gain priority in a sectoral structure where small and medium-sized companies, subcontractors and contracting services are predominant. On the contrary, the existing structure negatively affects the work conditions and occupational health and safety in many respects. With the growth of the construction sector, while employment rates increase, the rates of occupational accidents, occupational diseases, permanent incapacity and death also go up. Dissatisfaction of the construction workers with the profession and the low prestige attributed to this line of work lead to high labor turnover rates across the sector. The widespread seasonal work in the construction sector as well as the employment of domestic and foreign migrant workers further lower down the labor standards.\\n\\nTo fulfil its role in the development of Turkey sustainably and more importantly, to become a decent work area that values human rights, the construction industry needs to provide a more secure and safer work environment. Given the job and social insecurities and the low education of the workforce in general, the sector becomes trapped in a vicious cycle of low skill-low productivity, failing to initiate a sustainable growth pattern based on high value-added production. The sector will continue to show high sensitivity in the face of crises without raising the current work conditions to certain standards through an institutional restructuring.\\n\\nThis study aims to identify problems regarding the existent work standards in the Turkish construction sector and to develop policy recommendations for improvement. To this end, in light of the findings obtained from the literature review, an overall assessment of the construction sector and the work conditions is made based on a descriptive analysis of secondary data at sector and firm levels that cover the post-2000 period. In the analysis, data from the Turkish Republic Presidency Strategy and Budget Directorate, TURKSTAT, CBRT and SGK are used. Policy recommendations for improving the workplace standards are developed to enhance the health, skill and job satisfaction of the workers and to achieve a sustainable growth path in the sector.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The UAV is emerging as one of the greatest technology developments for rapid network coverage provisioning at affordable cost. The aim of this paper is to outsource network coverage of a specific area according to a desired quality of service requirement and to enable various entities in the network to have intelligence to make autonomous decisions using blockchain and auction mechanisms. In this regard, by considering a multiple-UAV network where each UAV is associated to its own controlling operator, this paper addresses two major challenges: the selection of the UAV for the desired quality of network coverage and the development of a distributed and autonomous real-time monitoring framework for the enforcement of service level agreement (SLA). For a suitable UAV selection, we employ a reputation-based auction mechanism to model the interaction between the business agent who is interested in outsourcing the network coverage and the UAV operators serving in closeby areas. In addition, theoretical analysis is performed to show that the proposed auction mechanism attains a dominant strategy equilibrium. For the SLA enforcement and trust model, we propose a permissioned blockchain architecture considering Support Vector Machine (SVM) for real-time autonomous and distributed monitoring of UAV service. In particular, smart contract features of the blockchain are invoked for enforcing the SLA terms of payment and penalty, and for quantifying the UAV service reputation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of theoretical analysis and efficacy of the proposed model.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Reinforcement of structural timber members with fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) rods offers merits over that of the conventional steel type. In recent times, near surface mounted (NSM) FRP reinforcement with timber has emerged as a promising alternative for reinforcing timber structures in both flexural and shear loading configurations. Previous investigations have shown that NSM FRP reinforcement technique has higher bond performance than externally\\nbonded equivalents because it (NSM FRP technique) is able to utilise the full capacity of the FRP materials. In spite of these merits, the investigations and the use of this innovative technique are limited. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to investigate the bond characteristics and performance of NSM basalt FRP reinforcement with solid timber structures. In order to predict the performance of the reinforced beam structures, unreinforced control timber members of the same timber characteristics were tested. The results showed that the average bond capacity of the NSM FRP reinforced members was 16% higher than the corresponding unreinforced beams.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop an existing collaborative research methodology process (Sabri, 2018), contextualise it for application in humanitarian supply chains and test it empirically. Design/methodology/approach: Building on collaborative research methodology and humanitarian supply chain literature, the Sabri’s (2018) collaborative research methodology process is further developed to comprise eight phases of collaborative research contextualised for the humanitarian supply chain domain. The process is applied in a collaborative research case of academia–practitioner knowledge co-creation in a humanitarian supply chain setting, focussing on environmental sustainability improvement. The collaborative case analysis suggests a number of refinements to the elements of the process. This study undertook two cycles of academia–practitioner collaborative research. Findings: In testing the process, a noticeable improvement in the collaboration among different humanitarian stakeholders was observed, leading to improved stakeholder management. The implementation improved the sustainability awareness and social inclusion of the affected population. Rurality, remoteness, security issues and resistance of field staff against change were among the main challenges for supply chain researchers to engage in collaborative research in the humanitarian domain. Originality/value: The paper addresses the rigour‒relevance‒reflectiveness debate in the humanitarian supply chain domain. A collaborative research methodology process derived from action research is further developed using humanitarian literature, and then it is applied in a humanitarian logistics case focussed on environmental sustainability. The present collaborative research process facilitates engaged scholarship among the humanitarian stakeholders, as the researchers’ roles move from observatory to participatory knowledge broker.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In academia, funding for conference attendance is limited, and both students and early-career researchers are therefore only able to attend a limited number of conferences. This means that, typically, researchers need to choose between attending multiple local and, at times, more affordable conferences, or one or two large, expensive, international conferences. Local and less expensive conferences may be research-specific but will have a smaller audience and lower networking potential. In biological\\nanthropology and bioarchaeology, the majority of these larger annual conferences are held in North America and Western Europe where travel and accommodation costs can be very high for those outside of these regions. These costs, in addition to visa restrictions, reduce the diversity of participants at academic conferences, skewing attendance to students and researchers from the host countries. Not only does this disadvantage individuals outside of the typical host-countries, but it also limits the breadth of academic dialogue, with inclusion in academic conferences determined all too often by financial resources\\nrather than academic value. This paper discusses the demographics and lack of diversity at some of these\\nlarge conferences and the factors that are known to limit international conference travel. It then presents the benefits of digital presentation methods using Digital Dilemma 2018 as a case study for how digital presentation methods can be combined with physical presentations at minimal cost and time. We hope\\nthat this will encourage more conferences to offer a digital presentation option in the future.',\n",

Three conditions arising from these disconnects are discussed: structural violence and discrimination frustrating the realization of women’s human rights, as well as their private and public contributions to food and nutrition security for all; many women’s experience of their and their children’s simultaneously independent and intertwined subjectivities during pregnancy and breastfeeding being poorly understood in human rights law and abused by poorly-regulated food and nutrition industry marketing practices; and the neoliberal economic system’s interference both with the autonomy and self-determination of women and their communities and with the strengthening of sustainable diets based on democratically governed local food systems. The book calls for a social movement-led reconceptualization of the right to adequate food toward incorporating gender, women’s rights, and nutrition, based on the food sovereignty framework.',\n",

These features warrant a new approach to feminists’ relationships with religion and spirituality. Rather than, as others have done, equating feminism with secularism, secularization, or alternative spiritualities, the article reveals the complex ways feminists forge religio-spiritual lives. The interview data demonstrate that it is unwise to see “spirituality” and “religion” as analytically distinct.

This review summarizes research into assessing vascular age from the PPG. Three categories of approaches are described: 1) those which use a single PPG signal (based on pulse wave analysis), 2) those which use multiple PPG signals (such as pulse transit time measurement), and 3) those which use PPG and other signals (such as pulse arrival time measurement).

The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical methodology to achieve and enhance organizational agility based on strategic objectives.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach\\nIn the first step, a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the organization being studied are recognized and classified under the perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC). Critical success factors are then identified by ranking the KPIs according to their importance in achieving organizational strategic objectives using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). In the second step, three houses of quality (HOQs) are constructed sequentially to identify and rank the main agile attributes, agile enablers, and improvement paths. In addition, in order to translate linguistics judgments of practitioners into numerical values in building HOQs, fuzzy logic is employed.\\n\\nFindings\\nThe capability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a case of a multi-national food company in Iran. Through the application, the company could find the most suitable improvement paths to improve its organizational agility.\\n\\nResearch limitations/implications\\nA limited number of KPIs were chosen due to computational and visual constraints related to HOQs. Another limitation, similar to other agility studies, which facilitate decision making among agility metrics, was that the metrics were more industry-specific and less inclusive.\\n\\nPractical implications\\nA strong practical advantage for the application of the methodology over directly choosing agility metrics without linking them is that through the methodology, the right metrics were selected that match organization’s core values and marketing objectives. While metrics may ostensibly seem unrelated or inappropriate, they actually contributed to the right areas where there were gaps between the current and desired level of agility. It would otherwise be impossible to choose the right metrics without a structured methodology.\\n\\nOriginality/value\\nThis paper proposes a novel methodology for achieving organizational agility. By utilizing and linking several tools such as BSC, fuzzy TOPSIS, and quality function deployment (QFD), the proposed approach enables organizations to identify the most appropriate agile attributes, agile enablers, and subsequently agile improvement paths.',\n",

A particular focus is placed on comparing and contrasting Central and Eastern Europe countries (CEECs) with those from the former Soviet Union, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The impact of the share of employees with higher education, provision of on-the-job training, years of experience of the top manager and labour cost on export intensity is assessed. To test these relationships, Tobit and Fractional Logit approaches are adopted. The estimation results suggest that, overall, having a more educated workforce exerts a positive impact on the export intensity of firms in transition economies, the magnitude being larger for CEECs. Average labour cost, as an alternative measure, also turns out to exert a positive but stronger impact. Insufficient evidence is found of a role for training programmes and years of experience of the top manager.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Physical layer security (PLS) is considered as a promising technique to prevent information eavesdropping in wireless systems. In this context, cooperative relaying has emerged as a robust solution for achieving PLS due to multipath diversity and relatively lower transmission power. However, relays or the relay operators in the practical environment are unwilling for service provisioning unless they are incentivized for their cost of services. Thus, it is required to jointly consider network economics and relay cooperation to improve system efficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint network economics and PLS using cooperative relaying and jamming. Based on the double auction theory, we model the interaction between transmitters seeking for a particular level of secure transmission of information and relay operators for suitable relay and jammer assignment, in a multiple source-destination networks. In addition, theoretical analyses are presented to justify that the proposed auction mechanism satisfies the desirable economic properties of individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness. As the participants in the traditional centralized auction framework may take selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a decentralized and trustless auction framework based on blockchain technology. In particular, we exploit the smart contract feature of blockchain to construct a completely autonomous framework, where all the participants are financially enforced by smart contract terms. The security properties of the proposed framework are also discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction\\nTreatment adherence in kidney transplant patients is particularly challenging during adolescence and young adulthood. This produces adverse consequences such as higher transplant failure, decreased quality of life and increased mortality. A novel qualitative creative problem-solving method (KJ Ho), widely used in Japan, has been applied in the United Kingdom (UK) to disentangle clinicians’ and young kidney transplant patients’ perspectives on this problem area. The study forms the first stage in the development of a user-driven digital intervention to improve long-term treatment adherence. KJ-Ho has contributed widely to clinical practice and knowledge in multiple contexts in Japan; our first application of this method in the UK should similarly contribute to improving post-transplant practice and knowledge.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\nKJ Ho is a Japanese creative problem solving method to organize qualitative research data. Clinicians were invited to take part in a two hour creative workshop. Data were analysed in a step-wise approach from which several overarching themes emerged. Similar workshops for patients (aged from 13 – 30 years) and their family members are being conducted. KJ Ho findings will be synthesized with two systematic literature reviews being undertaken in parallel.\\n\\nResults and Discussion\\nSix overarching themes were identified during the clinicians’ workshop: (1) non-adherence; (2) communication; (3) continuity in care; (4) values; (5) family; (6) patient-centred. Similar data concerning young kidney transplant patients’ needs is currently being collected and analysed. Triangulation of the KJ Ho data with standard systematic review outputs will provide a robust evidence base for intervention development.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIntegration of this original KJ Ho problem-solving method with standard Western systematic literature review methods can better identify factors currently influencing treatment adherence. This co-creation phase will be followed by a co-design stage to produce a digital intervention able to improve treatment adherence among young kidney transplant patients, which will be tested in a future large-scale trial.',\n",

Osteometric data from PMCT is known to be as accurate as taking direct measurements. Digital radiography is more accessible and affordable than PMCT but is limited due to the magnification of its subjects.\\n\\nObjectives\\nTo investigate the viability of implementing digital radiographic techniques for measurement of long bones, and to establish whether magnification can be accurately corrected for.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\nTwenty hind pig (Sus scrofa) legs were imaged using computed radiography (CR) and PMCT, and osteometric data obtained from the digital images and 3D CT volume reconstructions. Direct measurements were taken following maceration. A calibration object was imaged using CR, to provide magnification correction factors.\\n\\nResults\\nAccuracy was determined by mean absolute error (AE), giving values of 3.3\\u202f± 2.5\\u202fmm for PMCT (MPR), 2.4\\u202f± 1.3\\u202fmm for PMCT (3D), 11.1\\u202f± 7.4\\u202fmm for CR (PA), and 18.3\\u202f± 14.5\\u202fmm for CR (LAT). PMCT data was more accurate than CR data. Through applying correction for magnification, CR data became closer to the direct measurement data, and stature estimation was substantially altered.\\n\\nConclusion\\nMagnification in computed radiography affects osteometric data and resulting stature estimations. Applying correction factors may be a viable option for improving accuracy. For digital radiography to be used reliably in forensic anthropology, further empirical research is needed to validate a magnification correction method.',\n",

Such research tacitly maintains modernist notions of the public/private distinction in which the private sphere is considered less relevant to concerns of social justice. However, UK crime and social justice policy has increasingly intervened in the home lives of the poorest British families. Further, such policies have been legitimated by drawing on (or not contesting) media imagery that constructs these family lives almost entirely negatively, obscuring their complexity. Drawing on childhood studies research, and a project that employed visual methods to explore belonging among young people in foster, kinship or residential care, this article examines participants’ often fragile efforts to find or forge places in which they could feel ‘at home’ and imagine a future. In so doing, it invites visual activists to reconsider their understanding of public and private spaces in order to contest prevalent unsympathetic policy representations of poorer young people’s lives, to focus greater attention on their need for support, and to extend imaginations of their futures.',\n",

Using a stratified sample of 10 organisations across 4 sectors, 7 hypotheses are tested on data collected from 301 practitioners. A two-stage model is analysed using structural equation modelling.

The current research aimed to examine potential associations between autism traits and symptoms of psychosis, social and role functioning, and quality of life. 99 individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis took part in a cross-sectional interview and self-report questionnaire which assessed current symptoms of psychosis, autism traits, functioning, and quality of life. Participants were found to have a high level of autism traits. Higher autism traits were associated with poorer quality of life, functioning, and current psychotic symptoms. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses indicated that optimal AQ cut-off scores to predict severity of psychosis symptoms, functioning, and quality of life were lower than those used to suggest likely autism-spectrum diagnosis. Results suggest that autism traits are associated with poorer clinical presentation in first-episode psychosis populations, even in those whose traits fall below potentially diagnostic thresholds for autism. Psychosis services should be prepared to adequately address the needs of individuals with higher autism traits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have been widely used to describe the electrical dynamics of lithium-ion batteries. A high model accuracy is important for effective simulation and control of the battery system. The model accuracy depends on the design of experiment (DoE) method for battery test and the optimisation approach for ECM parameter identification. While many optimisation approaches have been proposed in literature to identify the parameters, the effect of DoE on the model accuracy is usually overlooked and undervalued. A novel DoE method is proposed in this paper which uses both partial discharge test (PDT) and deep discharge test (DDT) for battery testing. It is shown through careful test data analysis that, the conventional DoE methods using either PDT or DDT cannot capture the battery's dynamics to sufficient accuracy. Experimental data are collected using a commercial lithium ion battery. Results show the new DoE method can significant improve the ECM accuracy, i.e., reducing the root mean square error by ~70% in comparison with conventional DoE approach. In addition, the improved model accuracy contributes to a significant increase in the SoC estimation accuracy using extended Kalman filter.\",\n",

We find that the size of the firm, asset maturity and liquidity have significant effects in extending the maturity of debt employed by Chinese companies. The amount of collateralized assets and growth opportunities also tend to be important. However, proxies for a firm's quality and effective tax rate apparently report mixed or unexpected results. Debt market and equity market conditions are also examined in relation to corporate loan maturity. The system-GMM results show that market factors seem to influence debt maturity decisions.

We rely on firm level data obtained from the Amadeus database and annual input-output tables. The results from dynamic panel model estimations reveal that local manufacturing firms benefit from the presence of foreign firms in upstream services, especially in the knowledge intensive services, and in downstream manufacturing sector. Demonstration effect is found to be negatively associated with domestic firms’ productivity, while worker mobility and increased competition appear to be the main channels of horizontal knowledge diffusion. The firms’ productivity is also influenced positively by human capital and intangible assets.

       "  'abstract': 'The combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and transmit antenna selection (TAS) techniques has recently attracted significant attention due to the low cost, low complexity, and high diversity gains. Meanwhile, random linear coding (RLC) is considered to be a promising technique for achieving high reliability and low latency in multicast communications. In this paper, we consider a downlink system with a multi-antenna base station and two multicast groups of single-antenna users, where one group can afford to be served opportunistically, while the other group consists of comparatively low-power devices with limited processing capabilities that have strict quality of service (QoS) requirements. In order to boost reliability and satisfy the QoS requirements of the multicast groups, we propose a cross-layer framework, including NOMA-based TAS at the physical layer and RLC at the application layer. In particular, two low-complexity TAS protocols for NOMA are studied in order to exploit the diversity gain and meet the QoS requirements. In addition, RLC analysis aims to facilitate heterogeneous users, such that sliding window-based sparse RLC is employed for computational restricted users, and conventional RLC is considered for others. Theoretical expressions that characterize the performance of the proposed framework are derived and verified through simulation results.',\n",

During hot-press forming, zinc can infiltrate the underlying grain boundaries during the heat and forming step, leading to intergranular cracking of the base metal. In this study, samples of coated 22MnB5 steel were heated in a furnace at temperatures of 880, 900 and 920°C for 240 to 600 s and subsequently hot-formed into U-shaped profiles. Microstructure, morphology and depth of cracks were analysed using conventional optical and scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and focused ion beam imaging. The distribution of Zn in the heated coatings and underlying substrate was measured in detail by energy dispersive spectroscopy in transmission electron microscopy with samples taken out from the coating/base metal interfaces applying an in-plane focused ion beam lift-out method. In general the heating conditions do not appear to have effect on the density and spatial distribution of cracking in the top-wall and in the side-wall, but concerning the depth of penetration into the martensite/prior austenite substrate there is clear evidence that with extended heating time and temperature the depth of the penetration into the substrate and also the amount of penetrating cracks inside the top-wall is reduced. However full understanding of the role of heating condition on microcrack formation in zinc coated 22MnB5 has not been achieved at this stage yet; further work is underway and will be published later.',\n",

Families who have a child with a rare chromosome disorder (RCD) are a challenging group to include. We report the findings of 2 large‐scale surveys, undertaken by the UK RCD Support Group Unique, of these families' experiences over a 10‐year period. Seven stages of the patient journey were examined. From pre‐testing, through diagnosis, genetics consultation, clinical follow‐up and peer support. Overall, 1158 families replied; 36.4% response rate (2003) and 53.6% (2013). Analysis of responses identifies significant differences (P < .001) over time with a decrease in results reported face to face (76%‐62%), doubling by telephone (12%‐22%), improved explanation of chromosome disorder (57%‐75%), and increased signposting to peer support group (34%‐62%). However, conduct of the consultation raises a number of important questions. Overall, 28 aspects of the patient journey are recognised as requiring improvement; only 12/28 are currently incorporated in UK service specifications. Involvement of RCD families has identified key service improvements. This approach can empower those affected by such extremely rare disorders, and also enable professionals to design improved services in partnership with “expert families.” Further surveys are planned.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This report forms part of the Liveable Lives study, a largescale qualitative research project examining views and experiences of everyday help and support – low-level, ordinary and often unnoticed acts and relationships that can help us to manage the practical and emotional challenges of our daily lives. Everyday help and support – low-level, ordinary and often routine acts and relationships that help us to manage the practical and emotional challenges of our daily lives – is little noticed, studied or understood. Much of this takes place in the realm of the wholly interpersonal. But there is also a ‘middle layer’, between the interpersonal and the world of formal service provision. This consists of diverse groups, associations and organisations which typically lack any formal remit for help and support but which nevertheless make an important contribution to an overarching ‘infrastructure of kindness’. The main report from the Liveable Lives study focused on experiences of everyday help and support involving family, friends, neighbours, acquaintances and even strangers. This supplementary paper looks at the related issue of the wide range of local ‘middle layer’ groups, organisations and associations and at the role these play in enabling, sustaining or constraining such relations. Specific settings examined included a supermarket, a library and a group working to create a community garden. The middle layer has an important role to play in creating the conditions for ‘ordinary kindness’ simply by encouraging social interaction. Groups, organisations and associations in this realm draw people together through shared interest or purpose; they provide spaces within which interaction can happen, and sometimes actively facilitate access to those spaces. As such, they serve as junction boxes, connecting diverse strands of community and social networks. But spaces and opportunities in this layer are experienced differently by different people and in different social and economic contexts. For example, the research suggests that those from middle class, professional backgrounds may feel more confident about engaging with self-organised groups and associations, such as ramblers, book groups or other interest-based activity. Those in a predominantly working class area like Maryhill can set greater store by known, informal connections; and there is a greater role for ‘provided’ spaces and activities, such as those based in local community centres. While there may be an apparent fit between the not-for-profit sector (such as the library) and notions of everyday help and support, ‘ordinary kindnesses’ are evident in corporate or commercial settings too – whether a supermarket, café or corner shop. The significance of all these middle layer settings varies from one community to another, depending on what other facilities are available and the extent to which people live highly local or more geographically extended lives. Within the more formal organisational settings of the middle layer, it is often when individuals transcend their formal or scripted roles that there is the greatest scope for small acts and relationships of help and support to emerge. While this might carry some risks for organisations – if for example, staff in a library or supermarket are distracted from the core tasks of lending books or selling groceries – it can also be seen as congruent with good customer service and as part of what attracts people to those particular settings in the first place. Groups, organisations and associations at this level can also learn something from the way that everyday help and support is navigated and negotiated between individuals – for example, about the difficulty that people have in acknowledging vulnerability and asking for help; the way that help and support often happens most easily ‘in passing’; and the scope to derive benefits that are mutual from participation and engagement in community settings. A sense of achievement and social connection reported by members of the community garden is an example here.

However, the clinical significance of this on outcomes such as depression and suicidal thinking has not been explored. This study examines the association of autism spectrum traits, depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviour in individuals with psychotic experiences. In two cross sectional studies, individuals from a non-help seeking university student sample and patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) service completed standardized measures of autism spectrum traits, psychotic experiences, depressive symptoms and suicidal thinking. In healthy non-help seeking students, increased autism traits and increased subclinical psychotic experiences were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; a significant interaction effect suggests their combined presence has a greater impact on depression. In FEP, high autism traits and positive symptoms were associated with increased depression, hopelessness and suicidality, however there was no significant interaction effect. In FEP a multiple mediation model revealed that the relationship between autism traits and risk for suicidality was mediated through hopelessness. Young people with subclinical psychotic experiences and all patients with FEP should be screened for autism spectrum traits, which may have significant impact on clinical outcomes. Tailored interventions for patients with high levels of autistic spectrum co-morbidities in FEP should be a priority for future research.',\n",

We address the problem of selecting the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD), an important algorithm in Symbolic Computation. Prior work to apply ML on this problem implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to select between three existing human-made heuristics, which did better than anyone heuristic alone. Here we extend this result by training ML models to select the variable ordering directly, and by trying out a wider variety of ML techniques. We experimented with the NLSAT dataset and the Regular Chains Library CAD function for Maple 2018. For each problem, the variable ordering leading to the shortest computing time was selected as the target class for ML. Features were generated from the polynomial input and used to train the following ML models: k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT) and SVM, as implemented in the Python scikit-learn package. We also compared these with the two leading human-made heuristics for the problem: the Brown heuristic and sotd. On this dataset all of the ML approaches outperformed the human-made heuristics, some by a large margin.',\n",

By analyzing the CTD curve, the capacity and SOC difference can be achieved. The first-order resistance circuit model is used for the series charging curve simulation. Further experimental verification is conducted using two groups of four cells in series. In simulations and experiments, the error of the proposed capacity estimation method and the initial SOC error are less than 1%.

The effects of creep coefficient on interface restraint capacity and ensuing cohesive zone length were clearly evaluated. The results showed that the applied curvature due to the measured shrinkage strain was inadequate to cause critical de-bonding. In the FEA results, while the rate of interface energy release generally varies as a function of the bi-material relative stiffness and overlay structural scale, it is also evident that the two variables lose effects as the overlay structural scale approaches 0.50. The overall indicative trend shows that the rate of energy release in compliant overlay when relative stiffness( α<0) is higher than when α>0.

The leverage ratio is also affected by the market conditions in which the firm operates. The degree and effectiveness of these determinants are dependent on the country's legal and financial traditions. The results also confirm that firms have target leverage ratioswith French firms being the fastest in adjusting their capital structure toward their target level and Japanese firms the slowest. Overall, the capital structure of a firm is heavily influenced by the economic environment and its institutions, corporate governance practices, tax systems, the borrower-lender relation, exposure to capital markets, and the level of investor protection in the country in which the firm operates.\",\n",

The genre instantiation approach to teaching academic writing builds on two central principles: the identification of key genres for the target discipline-levels, and the exemplification of these through instances of successful student writing. This enables teachers to develop programmes that raise genre awareness, where learners can engage with instances from across specific topics, courses, levels and disciplines.

The probability that the destination node will fail to recover the packets of all source nodes has been bounded and approximated in the literature for the case of relay nodes that randomly assign only nonzero values to the coefficients of linear combinations of data packets. The paper argues for the necessity of giving relay nodes the choice to also assign the zero value to coefficients when arithmetic operations are over finite fields of small size, e.g. GF(2). Alternative probability mass functions for the coefficients are considered, and expressions for the decoding failure probability are re-derived.',\n",

Largely, the focus of this journal has been on the transmissive aspect of forensic imaging, and therefore a significant number of high-quality case studies have been published focusing on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. As a result, the ‘and imaging’ aspect is often neglected. Since 2013, technology has fundamentally evolved, and a number of new techniques have become accessible or have been demonstrated as particularly useful within many sub-disciplines of forensic science. These include active and passive surface scanning techniques, and the availability of three-dimensional printing. Therefore, this article discusses non-contact techniques, their applications, advantages, and considerations on the current state of play of imaging in forensic science.',\n",

As a critical discussion of the panel’s themes, the paper describes the complex system in which Academic Writing Tutoring takes place, contextualised within the Centre for Academic Writing (CAW) at Coventry University, UK. Beginning with a consideration of what constitutes a ‘writing tutor’ in contemporary contexts and at CAW, the paper outlines a range of academic writing support identities and roles, unravels the institutional drivers that shape them, and offers perspectives on reconciling apparently disparate roles. Next, the paper addresses the issue of agency in terms of the challenges of enculturating writing tutors into communities of practice, discourse communities, and research networks. This is done with a view to reflecting on the practices in CAW and beyond, thus demonstrating the need for varied development and support pathways to facilitate the move towards online delivery amid, and after, a time of global crisis, namely, the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion centres on how challenges can be overcome through sustained professional development, focusing on the role of technology in not only refashioning academic writing support, but also the roles and practices of Academic Writing Tutors at CAW. Issues of digital pedagogies, technologies, and digital literacies permeate this discussion of the online pivot and crisis pedagogies, offering analysis, reflections, and questions to guide future directions in (online) Academic Writing Tutor development and academic writing (crisis) pedagogies research.',\n",

The ability of AZ91 strip to undergo superplastic or superplastic-like deformation in longitudinal direction, in transverse direction, and in 45 degrees to longitudinal direction was investigated with no further thermal or thermomechanical processing applied prior to the testing. At temperature 350 oC and medium strain rate the maximum elongation reached almost 200% in direction parallel to the strip casting, however in the transverse and 45 degrees direction, different temperature, and at higher strain rates the maximum elongation was lower. Based on microstructural investigation by means of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) it could be seen that continuous dynamic recrystallization of initial coarse dendritic as-cast microstructure during elevated temperature deformation is active and responsible for high elongations. Additional analysis is provided by means of a strain rate sensitivity characterization and its evolution with increased level of strain.

However, many eligible people are not completing the programme. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of delivering a web-based CR intervention for those who decline/drop out from usual CR. Intervention A web-based CR programme for 6 months, facilitated with remote support. Methods Two-centre, randomised controlled feasibility trial. Patients were randomly allocated to web-based CR/usual care for 6 months. Data were collected to inform the design of a larger study: recruitment rates, quality of life (MacNew), exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test) and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Feasibility of health utility collection was also evaluated. Results 60 patients were randomised (90% male, mean age 62±9 years, 26% of those eligible). 82% completed all three assessment visits. 78% of the web group completed the programme. Quality of life improved in the web group by a clinically meaningful amount (0.5±1.1 units vs 0.2±0.7 units: control). Exercise capacity improved in both groups but mood did not change in either group. It was feasible to collect health utility data. Conclusions It was feasible to recruit and retention to the end of the study was good. The web group reported important improvements in quality of life. This intervention has the opportunity to increase access to CR for patients who would otherwise not attend. Promising outcomes and recruitment suggest feasibility for a full-scale trial.

This paper proposes an innovative framework to measure and decrease patient dissatisfaction with hospital services. First, a validated and verified SERVQUAL-based questionnaire is proposed to be distributed among patients. Then, according to the collected data, the level of dissatisfaction is monitored by deploying a p-chart and a Demerit chart. Finally, in order to identify long-term improvement opportunities, an improvement index and Pareto chart have been exploited. The usefulness of the proposed framework is illustrated by the application on a case study in a public hospital of Iran. The results revealed that both the Demerit chart and p-chart are quite competent in monitoring patients’ dissatisfaction and alarming out-of-control situations. In the studied hospital, food service was found to be the critical challenge that required both immediate and long-term improvements. Nurses’ criteria should receive immediate improvement while long-term efforts should be devoted to hospital environment and facilities.\",\n",

However, no studies have explored how autistic traits may interact with current models of suicidal behaviour in a non-clinical population. The current study therefore explored how self-reported autistic traits interact with perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging in predicting suicidal behaviour, in the context of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS). 163 young adults (aged 18-30 years) completed an online survey including measures of thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness (Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire), self-reported autistic traits (Autism Quotient), current depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), and lifetime suicidality (Suicidal Behaviours Questionnaire - Revised). Results showed that burdensomeness and thwarted belonging significantly mediated the relationship between autistic traits and suicidal behaviour. Autistic traits did not significantly moderate the relationship between suicidal behaviour and thwarted belonging or perceived burdensomeness. Results suggest that the IPTS provides a useful framework for understanding the influence of autistic traits on suicidal behaviour. However, the psychometric properties of these measures need to be explored in those with clinically confirmed diagnosis of ASC.',\n",

This paper investigates whether the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) enables an analysis of the complex interrelations and interdependencies between SEs, destination communities’ livelihood assets, and related transforming structures and processes. Design/methodology/approach: Data was gathered through participatory action research at a tourism lodge and its foundation, which facilitated agricultural training, and by conducting in-depth interviews with ten key stakeholders. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) served as the theoretical framework. Findings: The SLA enables an analysis of interrelations and interdependencies between various stakeholders and to visualise the way SEs forge the impacts tourism has on livelihoods. The agricultural project did not reach its full potential due to, amongst other factors, competing aims between the profit and non-profit business, resulting in the lack of a clear vision and strategy. Additional challenges were dependency on external funding and a lack of reciprocal communication between the stakeholders involved. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on one case study and findings cannot be generalised. Future studies should develop the SLF further, possibly through adaptation and integration of other tools. Practical implications: The SLF enables researchers to integrate local knowledge and participatory research methods, thus facilitating engagement and learning between different stakeholders. Originality/value: Through empirical research, this paper adds valuable insights into the applicability of the SLF in the context of social entrepreneurship in tourism.',\n",

I make a case for the academic and political relevance of research projects that are interdisciplinary – and that, therefore, generate multi-layered knowledge by starting from various points of view – as well as projects that are comparative in nature in the sense that they do not isolate a specific social group or trend but reveal certain specificities through comparison. As a religious studies scholar interested in the construction of differences (religious, ethnic, gender, sexuality), I believe it is increasingly important to study and compare different identities and communities in contemporary diverse West-European contexts. Such comparative research provides insights in the many commonalities, but also variances, between various groups of people, not as essential differences, but as differences-being-made-and-in-the-making. To give an example: How and why are the identities and experiences of Christian, Muslim, and secular women (or youth, men, or LGBTQ’s) similar or divergent? Interdisciplinary comparative research may yield insights into unexpected complexities but also possibilities for political solidarity. Thinking through the above questions, I will start this essay with a review of the 2016 book by Line Nyhagen and Beatrice Halsaa, Religion, Gender and Citizenship: Women of Faith, Gender Equality and Feminism. I then point at some other research examples on religion, gender, and sexuality across different European contexts that are exemplifying the type of interdisciplinary and comparative research that I find to be so crucial',\n",

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the integration of both schemes into wireless networks in order to reap their benefits, while considering security concerns. This paper considers a multi-relay network, where relay nodes employ RLNC to encode confidential data and transmit coded packets to a destination in the presence of an eavesdropper. Four relay selection protocols are studied covering a range of network capabilities, such as the availability of the eavesdropper's channel state information or the possibility to pair the selected relay with a node that intentionally generates interference. For each case, expressions for the probability that a coded packet will not be recovered by a receiver, which can be either the destination or the eavesdropper, are derived. Based on those expressions, a framework is developed that characterizes the probability of the eavesdropper intercepting a sufficient number of coded packets and partially or fully recovering the confidential data. Simulation results confirm the validity and accuracy of the theoretical framework and unveil the security-reliability trade-offs attained by each RLNC-enabled relay selection protocol.\",\n",

The regression analysis was adopted to test these hypotheses. The specific econometric method used for panel data is generalised method of moments (GMM).\\nFindings\\n\\nThe evidence records a few similarities in debt‐mix structure of German and UK firms but it also detects some important differences. Therefore, the paper concludes that the relation between dependent and explanatory variables is country‐dependent.

Future research could be to extend the number of countries to have a better idea for the impact of institutional factors on corporate debt‐mix.\\nPractical implications\\n\\nThe findings confirm that the debt ownership decision of listed firms is not only the result of their own characteristics but also the outcome of legal and financial environment and corporate governance traditions in which they operate. The way managers decide about the type of debt financing is not universal. Furthermore, the factors such as liquidation and renegotiation, moral hazard and adverse selection, flotation costs are found to be significantly relevant while deciding the mix of corporate debt.\\nOriginality/value\\n\\nThis study offers a unique comparison of the evidence from a bank‐based economy (Germany) and a market‐based economy (UK) that should have direct implications on the choice between bank debt and public debt.

The precast concrete segment joint was idealised as a two-dimensional (2D) prismatic block and subjected to a 6000kN compressive load. The varying contact lengths due to deformation of the linings and joint rotation under loading was represented as varying load widths in the idealised model. The Mohr Coulomb model was used to approximate the non-linear behaviour of concrete in tension and compression with an introduction of tension cut-off to the Mohr Coulomb model to represent the tensile capacity of concrete based on mean tensile strength. The transverse tensile bursting stresses in the idealised block was analysed for different load width ratios (a/d) and compressive strengths of concrete and presented as proportions of the uniformly distributed basic stress on the idealised block. The tensile bursting stress distributions for varying load widths and characteristics concrete strengths was developed into design charts for use by engineers in industries to eliminate the need for extensive finite element analysis and use of empirical relations. The area under the bursting stress distribution curve is the total bursting force and was found to decreases with increase in load width ratio.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with cerebral and coronary artery disease. Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of people over 55 years; many more have asymptomatic PAD. Early detection enables modification of arterial disease risk factors. Diagnostically, assessment of symptoms or signs can be unreliable; ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) testing is time-consuming and few healthcare professionals are properly trained. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG), an alternative non-invasive test for PAD, in primary care. PAD patients identified from general practice registers were age- and sex-matched with controls. Participants were assessed using MPPG, ABPI and duplex ultrasound (DUS). Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of MPPG and ABPI (relative to DUS) and concordance. MPPG test results were available in 249 of 298 eligible participants from 16 practices between May 2015 and November 2016. DUS detected PAD in 101/249 (40.6%). MPPG sensitivity was 79.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.9–87.6%), with specificity 71.9% (95% CI 63.7–79.2%). ABPI sensitivity was 80.2% (95% CI 70.8–87.6%), with specificity 88.6% (95% CI 82–93.5%). With comparable sensitivity to ABPI, MPPG is quick, automated and simpler to do than ABPI; it offers the potential for rapid and accessible PAD assessments in primary care.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'English across the curriculum as a philosophy is widely considered to be the backbone of curricula in schools. However, its introduction into the tertiary sector in Asia is relatively recent. With the re- structuring of secondary and tertiary education in Hong Kong, referred to as the 3+3+4 model, reducing secondary education by one year to expand the university curriculum to four years, Hong Kong universities have allocated increased resources towards General Education (GE) provision and literacy. In order to provide impetus for inter-institutional collaboration and relevant pedagogical development, the Hong Kong’s University Grants Committee launched the Competitive Funding Scheme on Teaching and Learning 2012-2015. This has resulted in new English across the curriculum initiatives. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University is leading three such inter-institutional projects, two of which focus on English Across the Curriculum. In addition, since 2012, it has implemented a university-wide requirement for students to complete a 2,500-word academic writing assignment as part of the GE curriculum. English Language Centre (ELC) staff provide detailed written, genre specific feedback on two drafts before the assignment is submitted to the subject teacher. The support tools and materials have been developed after a thorough genre-analysis. This compulsory scaffolded writing model has resulted in a significant impact on stakeholders’ perceptions about writing and its role in enhancing students’ learning. Colloquium participants, who are engaged in various EAC initiatives, will express their stances on the role of collaboration in scaffolding students’ language ability at the tertiary level and models of collaboration that have worked.',\n",

We investigated whether extending one or both of an infant’s legs affects the precision of CHL taken using an infantometer. The influence of staff training and infant cooperation were also examined.\\n\\nMethods\\nCHL was measured in children (aged 2), infants (aged 1) and newborns, by extending one or both legs. The subject’s level of cooperation was recorded. Mean differences were compared using Student’s t-test; intra- and inter-observer variability were assessed using Bland-Altman plots with 95 % limits of agreement. Intra- and inter-observer technical errors of measurement (TEMs) were also calculated.\\n\\nResults\\nMeasuring CHL in newborns using only one leg resulted in significantly longer measurements. Across all groups, there was less inter-observer variability using both legs; 95 % limits of agreement were lower and TEMs smaller. Larger measurement differences were seen if children were uncooperative.\\n\\nConclusions\\nThis study supports measuring CHL with both legs extended. The two-leg technique reduces variability and increases precision by allowing the measurer to control better the position and movements of the infant’s body.',\n",

The review drew on systematic review methodology but its objective was not to synthesise evidence, rather to generate a narrative critique of the use of photographic methods. Whilst the benefits of using participatory photography was clearly articulated in the literature, there was a lack of detailed reporting on how the methods were used in relation to data analysis and relatively little critical discussion of the limitations of photographic methods. Hence researchers are expending significant efforts to engage with visual methods through photography, but they may not be using photographic data to its best potential.\\n\\nPublisher Statement: This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/',\n",

While it acknowledges a critical pull away from first-tier cities like New York, this encyclopedia article makes the case for the persistence of an urbanized New York consciousness in scaled down, neighborhood-based cultural responses to contemporary processes of urbanization (like gentrification), responses that require critical attention as they unravel alternative stories of urban change. By aligning urban fictions to mobilizing trends in the multimedia documentation of the city’s changes, the article advances the notion of the politics of capture in, and via, urbanized cultural production that mediates an ideologically and historically modulated engagement with New York, mindful of urbanization processes, scalar socio-spatial practices, and power structures. From this critical urban position, the piece zooms in on Brooklyn neighborhoods and offers a fine-grained, “resistant reading” of two novels, A Meaningful Life (L. J. Davis, 1971) and The Fortress of Solitude (Jonathan Lethem, 2003), employed as illustrative case studies for a proposed urbanized literary hermeneutic. The article closes with a methodological corollary whereby the process underpinning this transdisciplinary hermeneutic is made transparent for further use in urban literary studies research.',\n",

Using the soft-laddering interviewing technique, we initially explore FQ attributes. Subsequently, we design and conduct two surveys to test the FQ measure. The final scale contains 18 items in four dimensions: transparency, associations, moderations and process. The FQ scale demonstrates good psychometric properties, passing all reliability and validity tests. The scale extends existing research on fairness and provides a new conceptualisation of FQ.

       "  'abstract': 'Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs which play a significant role in several biological processes. RNA-seq based transcriptome sequencing has been extensively used for identification of lncRNAs. However, accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed for prediction of lncRNAs based on the GENCODE, NONCODE and CANTATAdb databases. The prediction accuracy of these tools often drops when tested on transcriptomic datasets. This leads to higher false positive results and inaccuracy in the function annotation process. In this study, we present a novel tool, PLIT, for the identification of lncRNAs in plants RNA-seq datasets. PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L1 regularization and iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal features. Based on sequence and codon-bias features, it classifies the RNA-seq derived FASTA sequences into coding or long non-coding transcripts. Using L1 regularization, 31 optimal features were obtained based on lncRNA and protein-coding transcripts from 8 plant species. The performance of the tool was evaluated on 7 plant RNA-seq datasets using 10-fold cross-validation. The analysis exhibited superior accuracy when evaluated against currently available state-of-the-art CPC tools.',\n",

UK anxiety is high with lockdowns preventing a normal way of life for over a year. A lack of ability to travel freely causes numerous declines in quality of life including social isolation and poor physical and mental health. People need crowding information to choose safer travel options and subdue coronavirus. To provide effective guidance, it is essential to empirically formulate messaging to create clarity and trust which can be acted upon in confidence. Behaviour Change Techniques incorporating the Behaviour Change Wheel and COM-B model have been utilised in vast areas of public health intervention development and messaging. There is consensus that public transport information needs to be clearer and more accessible but BCTs have not been utilised in the development of public transport advice. This paper outlines the development of crowding messaging for public transport on a platform available to UK travellers. Barriers and facilitators were explored; related behaviours, intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were mapped. Specific message phrasing was developed utilising the mapped functions and advice from the literature. With the COVID-19 outbreak, having accessible and effective messaging for safely using public transport is a continuation of the work recently conducted examining the best ways to present public health information. It is important to be transparent when developing messaging and interventions accessible to the public and this work forms a basis for continued exploration and development in this area.',\n",

The\\nobjective is to select a subset of jobs and schedule them in such a way that the total net profit is maximized. The cost components considered include jobs' processing costs and weighted earliness/tardiness penalties. Two heuristic algorithms; namely scatter search (SS) and simulated annealing (SA), were employed to solve the problem for single machine environments. The algorithms were applied to several examples of different sizes with sequence-dependent setup times. Computational results were compared in terms of quality of solutions and convergence speed. Both algorithms were found to be efficient in solving the problem. While SS could provide solutions with slightly higher quality for large size problems, SA could achieve solutions in a more reasonable computational time.\",\n",

Our focus is particularly on the relation between cash holdings and leverage. We argue that the impact of leverage on cash balances of firms is likely to be non-monotonic. To the extent that leverage of firms acts as a proxy for their ability to issue debt one would expect a negative (substitution effect) relation between leverage and cash holdings. However, as leverage increases firms are likely to accumulate larger cash reserves to minimise the risk of financial distress and costly bankruptcy. Thus, one would expect a positive (precautionary effect) relationship between cash holdings and leverage at high levels of leverage. Our findings provide strong and robust support for a significant non-linear relation between cash holdings and leverage. Additionally, our results show that the impact of leverage on cash holdings partly depends on country-specific characteristics such as the degree of creditor protection, shareholder protection, and ownership concentration.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Utilising multiple disjoint paths in multiple channels can improve network performance by enabling a node to reroute data along discovered paths seamlessly when link failure is detected. However, depending on a stale/invalid route to recover from a broken link could increase the delay to recover from\\nthe broken link and degrade the network performance. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol (RIVC-MB) to enhance communication reliability in the multipath multichannel routing protocol. The reliability of transmitting/re-routing the data packet in multipath multichannel routing protocol is improved by providing early route invalidity detection and early switchover. Waiting time to access the medium is also improved, when a node is attempting to access a busy medium, by re-routing the data packet via the alternative route. The RIVC-MB protocol uses the cross-layer interaction between MAC and routing protocols to achieve these goals. The proposed protocol is implemented and extensively evaluated using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the new proposed protocol improves the endto- end delay, and reduces both the number of route error control packets and the number of dropped data packets in the routing layer. It also reduces reduces the collision rate in the MAC layer in a dense network.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper presents an experimental investigation on strength and hydraulic conductivity of a fine grained soil mixed with cement, Pulverised Fly Ash and Ground Granulated Blast Slag. Strength and permeability are important properties that defines the engineering behaviour of deep mixing improved soils. Cement contents of 4%, 8%, 12% and 16% by weight of dry soil were added using wet soil mixing technique. The percentages of cement were reduced and replaced with PFA, GGBS and Bentonite at 33.3% and 50% reductions respectively. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and permeability tests were conducted on cement, PFA/GGBS and Cement/Bentonite mixtures prepared at their respective optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) and cured for different periods. The results show that an increase in % of additives causes decrease in porosity and increase in density of cement and cement/PFA stabilised soil and hence, increase in UCS. Except at some optimum values of 12% and 16% of additives in C+PFA combinations where the density of the improved soil decreases at fairly constant porosity resulting to an increase in UCS. This implies that % of additive and the type of additive controls the UCS of improved soils more than the influence of porosity and density on UCS. Decrease in porosity of samples improved using C+PFA+GGBS and C+B with increase in % of additives, resulted to increase in UCS but however, the reduction in density and increase in UCS also shows dominance of % and type of additive on strength over porosity and density. Cement-Bentonite and combination of PFA /GGBS with reduced amount of cement were observed to better improved permeability of the soil. This study has also defined the functional relationships between hydraulic conductivity and additive type based on the investigated % of additives and combinations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Popular and academic accounts of university-based religion tend to privilege evangelical Christianity, presented as a morally conservative, conversionist movement at odds with university contexts, which are widely assumed to be vehicles for a progressive Western modernity. This is especially the case in the UK, given the association of higher education with secularisation, yet virtually no research has studied this interface by examining the lives of students. This article discusses findings from the three-year project “Christianity and the University Experience in Contemporary England”, including a nation-wide survey of undergraduate students, in examining how the experience of university shapes on-campus expressions of Christian identity. We argue that a sizeable constituency of undergraduates self-identify as ‘Christian’, but evangelicals emerge not as the dominant majority, but as a vocal minority. The emerging internal complexity is masked by a public discourse that conceives of religion in terms of propositional belief and presents evangelicalism as its pre-eminent form.',\n",

Adolescence is a time when appearance concerns become more salient for many young people and is acknowledged as a particularly challenging time for individuals with NF1. There is currently little research into the psychosocial impact of the appearance changes associated with NF1 during this stage of life. In order to address this, surveys of young people with NF1 aged 14–24 years (n = 73), and parents of young people with NF1 (n = 55) were developed following interview studies with these groups. The surveys included the Perceived Stigma Questionnaire, Social Comfort Questionnaire, Body Esteem Scale (appearance subscale) and the Subjective Happiness Scale. Young people and parents identified appearance as central to young peoples’ experience of NF1, however no significant difference was found on measures of body esteem, happiness, stigma or social comfort between those young people who reported their NF1 was noticeable to others and those who reported it was not. Findings from the parent survey indicated that their reports of greater perceived noticeability did relate to greater perceived stigma and lower levels of social comfort. Findings highlight the importance of attending to young people’s concerns around appearance in general and managing the possibility of future appearance changes, rather than the current noticeability of NF1.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with cerebral and coronary artery disease. Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of people over 55 years; many more have asymptomatic PAD. Early detection enables modification of arterial disease risk factors. Diagnostically, assessment of symptoms or signs can be unreliable; ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) testing is time-consuming and few healthcare professionals are properly trained. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG), an alternative non-invasive test for PAD, in primary care. PAD patients identified from general practice registers were age- and sex-matched with controls. Participants were assessed using MPPG, ABPI and duplex ultrasound (DUS). Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of MPPG and ABPI (relative to DUS) and concordance. MPPG test results were available in 249 of 298 eligible participants from 16 practices between May 2015 and November 2016. DUS detected PAD in 101/249 (40.6%). MPPG sensitivity was 79.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.9–87.6%), with specificity 71.9% (95% CI 63.7–79.2%). ABPI sensitivity was 80.2% (95% CI 70.8–87.6%), with specificity 88.6% (95% CI 82–93.5%). With comparable sensitivity to ABPI, MPPG is quick, automated and simpler to do than ABPI; it offers the potential for rapid and accessible PAD assessments in primary care.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental burdens in the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) production stage are essential issues for their sustainable development. In this study, eleven ecological metrics about six typical types of LIBs are investigated using the life cycle assessment method based on the local data of China to assess the ecological impacts and the possibility of carbon neutralization of battery production. Furthermore, the GHG emissions from battery production under electricity mixes in China in the next 40 years are predicted. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The GHG emissions in the production of ternary battery production in China are from 114.3 kg CO2-eq/kWh to 137.0 kg CO2-eq/kWh, which are greater than those of the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries (82.5 kg CO2-eq/kWh). It is found that the carbon emission from cathode production dominates the whole battery production, followed by battery assembly. (2) Almost all ecological indexes of LFP batteries are better than those of ternary batteries. It is beneficial to reduce environmental damage by prioritizing LFP batteries. (3) Under the electricity mixes in China in 2030 and 2060, GHG emissions from battery production will be reduced by at least 30% and 90% compared with 2020, respectively. Green energy is a powerful path to realizing carbon neutralization in battery production.',\n",

Together, persistent trade patterns and an unfavourable combination of demand and supply elasticities suggest that trade liberalization in isolation is not sufficient to promote exports but may need to be incorporated within a wider policy and institutional framework. In addition, our findings suggest that trade costs should be a particular focus for policy: distance has a big negative influence on Kosovo’s exports to EU countries; while diaspora communities promote Kosovo’s exports to EU markets, most likely because they offset trade costs.',\n",

The minimum creep rate of the alloy was almost two orders of magnitude lower than that forWE54-T6 and was similar to that for HZ32-T5. The creep behavior exhibited an extended tertiary creep stage, which was believed to be associated with precipitate coarsening. The creep stress exponent value was 4.5, suggesting that dislocation creep was the rate-controlling mechanism during secondary creep. At T = 573 K (300 C), basal slip was the dominant deformation mode. The activation energy for creep (Qavg = 221 ± 20 kJ/mol) was higher than that for self-diffusion in magnesium and was believed to be associated with the presence of second-phase particles as well as the activation of nonbasal slip and cross slip. This finding was consistent with the slip-trace analysis and surface deformation observations, which revealed that the nonbasal slip was active. The minimum creep rate and time-to-fracture followed the original and modified Monkman-Grant relationships. The microcracks and cavities nucleated preferentially at grain boundaries and at the interface between the matrix phase and the second phase. In-situ creep experiments highlighted the intergranular cracking evolution.',\n",

Cambridge: HRH The Prince of Wales’ Business and the Environment Programme, Cambridge Programme for Industry, 2001, Stern, Stern review executive summary. London: New Economics Foundation, 2006); however, potential liabilities for damages from extreme weather events due to emissions from carbon-intensive sectors present risks that may not be reflected in current share prices (Krosinsky, Robins, & Viederman, Evolutions in sustainable investing: Strategies, funds and thought leadership. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2012). Given the devastation of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, it is worth asking: how close are we to some companies or sectors being held liable, at least partially, for their activities around emissions? The answer may be that this is closer than many expect. The evolving field of extreme weather event attribution serves as a good example of how new science can raise important thought-provoking questions regarding the appropriate actions of both investors and companies under a changing climate and answer them with increasing confidence. In recent articles, Rayer and Millar (Investing in extreme weather conditions. Citywire Wealth Manager (429), 36, 2018a; Hurricanes hit company share prices. Citywire New Model Adviser (596), 18, 2018b; Physics World, 31(8), 17, 2018c) estimated that the top seven carbon-emitting publicly listed companies, under a hypothetical climate liability regime, might increasingly see around 1–2% losses on their market capitalisations (or share prices) from North Atlantic hurricane seasons. This chapter gives a comprehensive exposition of how that estimate was arrived at, as well as clarifying how it was quantified. Related aspects from a physical point of view are provided, with an associated general overview of the current state of the related science of climate change, alongside a focus on extreme weather events.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) is a key tool in computational algebraic geometry, best known as a procedure to enable Quantifier Elimination over real-closed fields. However, it has a worst case complexity doubly exponential in the size of the input, which is often encountered in practice. It has been observed that for many problems a change in algorithm settings or problem formulation can cause huge differences in runtime costs, changing problem instances from intractable to easy. A number of heuristics have been developed to help with such choices, but the complicated nature of the geometric relationships involved means these are imperfect and can sometimes make poor choices. We investigate the use of machine learning (specifically support vector machines) to make such choices instead. Machine learning is the process of fitting a computer model to a complex function based on properties learned from measured data. In this paper we apply it in two case studies: the first to select between heuristics for choosing a CAD variable ordering; the second to identify when a CAD problem instance would benefit from Gröbner Basis preconditioning. These appear to be the first such applications of machine learning to Symbolic Computation. We demonstrate in both cases that the machine learned choice outperforms human developed heuristics.',\n",

Receiver Directed Transmission protocol (RDT) is designed to provide multichannel access using a single radio interface. RDT introduces a clever approach to support channel assignment and negotiation without relying on a control channel or time synchronisation. Protocols based on the RDT scheme normally use an extra radio interface, dual home channel or time synchronisation to overcome the expected issues in RDT, such as, hidden terminal and deafness problems. This paper demonstrates that using RDT with a single radio and single home channel it is still possible to increase the network capacity. Additionally, the paper investigates the effect of node density, mobility and number of available channels on RDT performance. NS-2 simulator is used to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results confirm that using multichannel RDT scheme can effectively increase the throughput, the packet delivery ratio and reduce the delay compared to single channel protocol.',\n",

The scanning electronic microscopy of Aer-Tech sample had shown that through its image analysis that the Aer-tech microscopic structure are compassed with billions of air pores evenly connected. Appreciably, on axial compression co elapse acting similar to steel material. It is also observed that for sample without fibre glass there are a few large sized pores present and their number also increases with an increase in foam volume, which may be due to the possibility of merging and overlapping of pores at higher foam content.

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction Malawi has a substantial burden of chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) which cause significant morbidity and loss of economic productivity, affecting patients, families and health systems. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a highly recommended non-pharmacological intervention in the clinical management of people with CRDs. However, Malawi lacks published evidence on the implementation of PR for people with CRDs. This trial will test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a culturally appropriate hospital-based PR programme among adults with functionally limiting CRDs at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi.\\n\\nMethods and analysis This is a single-centre mixed-methods pre–post single-arm feasibility trial. Ten patients aged ≥18 years, with a spirometry confirmed diagnosis of a CRD and breathlessness of ≥2 on the modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale, will be consecutively recruited. Their baseline lung function, exercise tolerance and health status will be assessed; including spirometry, Incremental Shuttle Walk Test and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test, respectively. Pretrial semistructured in-depth interviews will explore their experiences of living with CRD and potential enablers and barriers to their PR uptake. Along with international PR guidelines, these data will inform culturally appropriate delivery of PR. We initially propose a 6-week, twice-weekly, supervised centre-based PR programme, with an additional weekly home-based non-supervised session. Using combination of researcher observation, interaction with the participants, field notes and informal interviews with the participants, we will assess the feasibility of running the programme in the following areas: participants’ recruitment, retention, engagement and protocol adherence. Following programme completion (after 6 weeks), repeat assessments of lung function, exercise tolerance and health status will be conducted. Quantitative changes in clinical outcomes will be described in relation to published minimal clinically important differences. Post-trial semistructured interviews will capture participants’ perceived impact of the PR programme on their quality of life, enablers, and barriers to fully engaging with the programme, and allow iteration of its design.\\n\\nEthics and dissemination Ethical approval for this trial was obtained from University of Malawi College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee (COMREC), Blantyre, Malawi (protocol number: P.07/19/2752) and University of Leicester Research Ethics Committee, Leicester, UK (ethics reference: 31574). The results of the trial will be disseminated through oral presentations at local and international scientific conferences or seminars and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. We will also engage the participants who complete the PR trial and the Science Communication Department at Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme to organise community outreach activities within Blantyre to educate communities about CRDs and PR. We will also broadcast our trial results through national radio station programmes such as the weekly “Thanzi la Onse” (Health of All) programme by Times Radio Malawi. We will formally present our trial results to Blantyre District Health Office and Malawi Ministry of Health.\\n\\nTrial registration number ISRCTN13836793.',\n",

An analysis of research into optimisation of marketing programmes reveals models largely focus on the optimisation task, but fail to present a holistic view. Whilst adopting a systematic approach, this paper develops a model for judging the appropriateness of a relationship marketing programme from the optimisation standpoint. As such, relationship marketing programme optimisation is treated as a complex problem consisting of three partial problems related on a parametric basis. These are forming an optimal relationship marketing programme, measuring return on relationship marketing activities and calculating costs of such activities. The methods applied integer programming, multiple regression analysis, factor analysis and heuristic algorithms. The model was tested by using large-scale data on 40,000 SMEs provided by a bank. The results showed a dramatic increase in efficiency when optimising marketing decisions by applying the suggested model. This paper is among the first to present such a holistic approach and to offer an original framework.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) currently constitutes the main mechanism for economic globalisation. Despite the rising integration of the Turkish economy into the global economy, FDI performance of Turkey remained lower than many other developing countries until the early 2000s. This was followed by a period of a boom in which Turkey attracted record levels of FDI inflows in her history. Accompanying these inflows, the country also achieved high rates of growth. However, high unemployment rates continued to be a major problem. This chapter seeks to explain the role of FDI inflows in job creation in Turkey at a sectoral level for the period 2000–2008. We use panel data analysis and find a positive, but weak relationship between FDI inflows and employment. Merger and acquisitions, as the dominant mode of foreign entry in Turkey, and/or the dominance of the FDI inflows in the financial sector after 2004 might be the reasons for this weak employment effect. Moreover, the tendency for the shift of foreign investment from low-tech to medium-and high-tech industries in Turkish manufacturing could lead to the negligible effect on employment.',\n",

Providing aspects of diabetes care online using Artificial Intelligence and deep learning enables more personalized care. Objective: This study aims to examine the usability and preliminary efficacy of an online nutrition platform to support people with diabetes and their carers in identifying healthy recipes, meal planning, and online shopping. Methods: Diabetes UK signposted people with diabetes and their carers through their website, social media and newsletters. Seventy-three adult participants with (pre)diabetes or their carers, completed the baseline online survey, as did 23 of these after 8 weeks of platform use. Online semi-structured interviews were performed with platform users (n=7) who agreed to be followed-up and diabetes experts (n=3) who had nutrition and/or platform knowledge. The intervention consists of an online platform, incorporating Artificial Intelligence and deep learning to personalize recipes, meal planning and shopping list experiences, and was made available for a period of 8 weeks. Baseline characteristics, satisfaction, system usability, and (diabetes-related) health indicators were assessed before and after 8 weeks of platform use. Results: Improvements in weight (MeanDiff: 4.5 kg/m2, 95% CI [1.0, 12.0], p=0.009, d=0.51 95% CI [0.07, 0.94]) and waist size (MeanDiff: 3.9 cm, 95% CI [2.0, 6.5], p=0.008, d=0.80 95% CI [0.24, 1.34]) were found. Most participants did not regularly use the platform but perceived it as accessible, user-friendly, and easy to use with some usability issues. Saving recipes was the most popular feature. Conclusions: This study indicated that the usability of the nutrition platform was well-perceived by its diabetes users for recipe inspiration, an area supported by Artificial Intelligence and deep learning. Because participants managed their diabetes well, adding in education would be specifically relevant for people less familiar with the role of diet in diabetes management. To assess the platform’s effectiveness in improving diabetes-related health indicators, controlled studies with a larger and more diverse participant sample, are recommended.',\n",

The minimum creep rate of the peak-aged (T6) alloy was almost two orders of magnitude lower than that for a WE54-T6 (Mg-5.2Y-3.6RE-0.5Zr (wt.%)) alloy. The peak-aged condition (T6) exhibited slightly greater creep resistance than the as-cast condition. The solution treated (T4) material exhibited the lowest creep resistance. The creep stress exponent (∼5) suggested that dislocation creep was the dominant secondary creep mechanism. The minimum creep rate and time-to-fracture could be described by the Monkman-Grant equation. An in-situ creep experiment indicated that intergranular cracking was prevalent in the tertiary creep regime and the crack propagation path tended to follow the grain boundaries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have been widely used for capturing the electrical behaviour of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, one limitation of the conventional full-cell level ECM is that it cannot capture the battery's internal states at half-cell level, e.g., the negative electrode (NE) potential. Real-time monitoring of NE potential is highly desirable for improving battery performance and safety, as it can prevent lithium plating which occurs when the NE potential drops below a threshold value. This paper proposes an easy-to-implement framework for real-time estimation of the NE potential of LIBs. An ECM at half-cell level is developed and parametrised by a bespoke experimental method, exemplified on a commercial 21700 LIB cell. The cell is instrumented with a lithium reference electrode that enables direct measurement of the per-electrode potential. Based on the developed model, an extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate the battery's NE potential and SoC in real-time using only onboard available signals including the terminal current and voltage. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high modelling and estimation accuracy. The root mean square error of the real-time NE potential estimation is below 8 mV. The low computational complexity of the developed algorithm can facilitate practical implementation in commercial BMS.\",\n",

In this work, we investigate the performance of the network-coded system in terms of the probability that the destination node will successfully recover the source packets of the two source nodes. We build our analysis on fundamental probability expressions for random matrices over finite fields and we derive upper bounds on the system performance for the case of systematic and non-systematic network coding. Simulation results show that the upper bounds are very tight and accurately predict the decoding probability at the destination node. Our analysis also exposes the clear benefits of systematic network coding at the source nodes compared to non-systematic transmission.',\n",

Designing an efficient and fast route recovery mechanism scheme without incurring extra overheads or delays to repair the broken link is a desirable goal for any routing protocol. The route recovery algorithm in reactive routing protocols like AODV occurs only after a link failure is detected. However, we propose a new route discovery mechanism called Route Migration over Multiple link failure in Multi-Channel (RMMMC), which combines multiple paths and channels to provide a disjointed alternative route. When link failure is detected, the RMMMC reroutes the data packet through the alternative route in alternative channels that have been previously discovered. Furthermore, the RMMMC is resilient to multiple link failures. Unlike other route recovery approaches, nodes in RMMMC are considered to be equipped with a single transceiver. The RMMMC scheme is implemented and extensively evaluated by using an ns-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better packet delivery ratio, throughput and reduces the routing overhead and end-to-end delay in a dense network.',\n",

The project aims to develop a pair of glasses that discreetly provides real-time feedback to the wearer about their facial muscle function, helping them practice their rehabilitative exercises regularly and correctly, thereby speeding recovery of normal, symmetric facial expressions. The glasses will contain all the required EMG sensors in a compact form factor, they will provide sensor data to a mobile application installed on a mobile phone or tablet. The mobile application will provide daily exercises and feedback to allow the patients to monitor their own progress through the rehabilitation process and will also pass on valuable information to therapists via a website. Therapists will monitor the progress of their patients and adjust exercise routines as required. They will also provide feedback through in application messaging and feedback tools while providing in depth analysis tools to spot potential problems such as synkinesis.',\n",

However, conventional recruitment and personnel selection methods may be unable to fulfil the task due to some uncertainties and complexities such as lack of past work experience or creeping subjectivity into the recruitment process of fresh graduates. This paper addresses the problem by proposing a two-fold recruitment approach which benefits from human resource personnel selection methods and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). A study of employment for an industrial organisation in Malaysia was conducted and the proposed model was applied. The study has shown the overriding role of university lecturers for the recruitment of fresh graduates. The consistency and validation of the model was examined through experimental procedures based on consistency test and sensitivity analysis.',\n",

Group of cement improved soil column can be overlapped to form a shear wall which can support side slopes of embankments to enhance stability of the supported structure. The overlap distance of these columns is one factor that influences the efficacy of the columns and their overall effect on performance of the supported structure. This paper presents a numerical investigation on the effect of overlap distance and chord angle of overlap on the performance of soil-cement columns. The analysis of results show that the total stress on the columns decreases initially from 89.9kPa to 83.1kPa at 0 and 0.16m overlap distance due to development of discontinuities and stress concentration at corners of overlapping columns. The total stress on the column also increases between 0.16 and 0.32m overlaps corresponding to e/d ratio of 0.2 to 0.4m. This implies that values between 0.2-0.4 can be adopted for ratio of overlap distance and column diameter in design of overlapping column.',\n",

In planning entry, we include children’s engagement and issues of researcher gender. In conducting the interviews, we consider issues such as the balance of power, the importance of building a rapport, the voluntary nature of consent and the need for a flexible interview structure. Finally, we address exiting from the child’s home with sensitivity at the end of the interview and/or research study. Undertaking research in the child’s home provides a known and familiar territory for the child, but it means that the researcher faces a number of challenges that require solutions whilst they are a guest in a child’s home.',\n",

AODV is a reactive MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to a dramatic collapse of network performance in the presence of blackhole attack. The paper introduces a new concept of Self-Protocol Trustiness (SPT) in which detecting a malicious intruder is accomplished by complying with the normal protocol behavior and lures the malicious node to give an implicit avowal of its malicious behavior. We present a Blackhole Resisting Mechanism (BRM) to resist such attacks that can be incorporated into any reactive routing protocol. It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms, but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious. No modifications to the packet formats are needed, so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes, and no extra communication. Using NS2 simulation, we compare the performance of networks using AODV under blackhole attacks with and without our mechanism to SAODV, showing that it significantly reduces the effect of a blackhole attack.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction\\nDuplex ultrasound (DUS), a non-invasive means of arterial mapping, allows for reliable diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). One of our authors (CPO), developed a standardised DUS-based scoring system, devised for rapid detection and reporting of PAD. The purpose of this study is to validate this system, determining diagnostic performance both overall, and per disease severity.\\n\\nMethods\\n250 participants were recruited, based on diagnosis (N = 125), or absence of PAD (N = 125) from GP registers. Right and left legs per subject were handled as independent readings, determining actual PAD status via ABPI <0.9, and then further grading disease severity using suggested ABPI ranges. Data were excluded if no corresponding ABPI value was obtained per DUS-determination, or if the ABPI reading was >1.4, owing to risk of false negatives due to incompressible vessels. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were obtained overall, and per severity classification. Furthermore, interrater agreement between ABPI- and DUS-determined PAD severity was determined by linear weighted Cohen’s Kappa.\\n\\nResults\\nThe sensitivity and specificity in the detection of disease overall was 81.0% (95% CI 73.4 - 87.2%) and 86.3% (95% CI 82.3 – 89.8%), respectively. From mild to severe PAD, sensitivity increased from 71.1% (95% CI 55.7 – 83.6%) to 89.3% (95% CI 71.8 – 97.7%). Furthermore, a Cohen Kappa value of 0.63 (95% CI 0.57 – 0.69) was obtained, indicating moderate agreement between the two diagnostic methods.\\n\\nConclusions\\nFindings in this study validate the diagnostic performance of the standardised DUS scoring system, as well as its capacity to grade severity of disease, offering a potential tool for the identification of PAD in the community / research settings following initial screening methods. Confirmatory work could include a comparison of DUS-determined disease with gold-standard methods of non-invasive angiography, and novel tools such as toe-flex NIRS and multi-site photoplethysmography.',\n",

However, NMC811 features relatively poor structural and thermal stabilities, which affect its cycle life. This study aims to address the limited data availability research gap on NMC811 low-temperature degradation. We aged commercial 21700 NMC811 cells at 0 °C under 0.5 C and 1 C current rates. After 200 cycles, post-mortem visual, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the inspections of harvested electrodes were conducted. In just 200 cold cycles, capacity drops of 25% and 49% were observed in cells aged at 1 C and 0.5 C, respectively. The fast degradation at low temperatures is largely due to lithium plating at the anode side during the charging process. The surprisingly better performance at 1 C is related to enhanced cell self-heating. After subsequent 3-month storage, the cells that experienced 200 cycles at 0 °C and 0.5 C became faulty (voltage: ≈ 0 V), possibly due to cell lithium dendrites and micro short circuits. This work demonstrates that NMC811 suffers from poor cold ageing performance and subsequent premature end-of-life.',\n",

First, deLahunta briefly describes how initial ideas evolved into a six-month research project involving several cognitive scientists and the support of an arts and science research fund. There follows discussion about why a choreographer might be interested in cognitive science in structured collaboration. Cognitive scientist Phil Barnard explains the background and one of the resulting experiments that took place and proposes further mutually beneficial research. In the final section, Wayne McGregor details his experience of working with cognitive scientists on Choreography and Cognition, which inspired the creation of AtaXia (2004) and inspired future plans.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The release of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) led the student initiative Food Revitalisation and Eco-Gastronomic Society of Hohenheim (FRESH) at the University of Hohenheim to start a participatory process that resulted in the establishment of the seminar ‘Ethics of Food and Nutrition Security’ in 2010 as a collaborative effort with the Chair of Gender and Nutrition at the University of Hohenheim (UHOH) and the International Centre for Ethics in the Sciences and Humanities (IZEW) at the University of Tübingen. This seminar follows the overall goal to equip young scientists with a firm foundation in interdisciplinary ethics-comprising basic knowledge of both ethical theories and tools to identify and analyse implications of food systems design and governance at the local and global levels – while developing their skills for practical application. We assess the development of the seminar since its inception, with particular focus on the introduction of a dynamic group work project in 2013/14 based on the ethical matrix originally suggested by Ben Mepham. The specificity of the new format was to work with the matrix in a culturally and ethically diverse student group, fostering interactive discussion among students, combined with input from external academic experts. Further, taking on different actors’ perspectives demanded students’ active and early engagement in the search for and critical examination of empirical evidence. These adaptations served the aim to strengthen the connection of the seminar’s two thematic blocks ‘Ethical theory and argumentation’ and ‘Practicing ethical analysis and argumentation’. The assessment of group work and a review of students’ evaluations indicate that we succeeded to provide students more effectively with a tool to integrate empirical, normative and evaluative knowledge. In order to proceed from ethical analysis to judgment, however, additional philosophical tools would need to be employed more intensely in future seminar rounds. Further recommendations include a stronger contextualisation of guest lectures, interactive selection of the actors considered in group work, and more involvement of non-academic experts. Institutional challenges are the financial limits to full co-teaching of UHOH and IZEW staff and the fluctuation of engaged FRESH members to sustain the participatory development of the specific format of this non-standard seminar.',\n",

Insight into patients’ experiences of monitoring physical activity is needed to inform future healthcare practice and policy utilizing this technology to support long-term positive health behavior change. This scoping review aimed to explore the experiences of using technology for monitoring physical activity among people with COPD. The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodological framework was used. Relevant scientific databases (CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library and Scopus) were searched from 1st January 2016 to 16th March 2021. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the data. Twelve studies exploring the experiences of people with COPD using technology for monitoring physical activity were included in the synthesis. Seven themes were developed and summarize experiences: 1) Monitoring and keeping track of their activity and health, 2) Supporting motivation to be active, 3) Acceptability of the device, 4) Experiencing technical issues with the device, 5) Setting appropriate and achievable goals for their health condition, 6) Integrating the device into their life and daily routine, and 7) Perceived physical and psychological benefits of using the device. Further high-quality research is needed to understand the experiences of people with COPD using technology to monitor physical activity in everyday life and better self-manage their health condition. Supporting people with COPD to monitor their physical activity could enable them to better self-manage their health condition.',\n",

A large number of attack types of varying severity are threatening MANET. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is a well-known reactive MANET routing protocol that does not support security of routing messages. In this paper, we study the performance of both DSR and its flow-state extension routing protocols in the presence of blackhole, grayhole, selfish and flooding attacks. We conclude that the performance of flow-state DSR is better than DSR in the presence of all attacks. Flooding attacks are found to dramatically impact all the standard performance metrics. Blackhole attacks significantly worse the packet delivery ratio in a static network using unmodified DSR. All the attacks greatly increase the end-to-end delay; an effect particularly marked in a static network.',\n",

The four-dimensional multiple-item scale demonstrates good psychometric properties, showing strong evidence of reliability as well as convergent, discriminant and nomological validity. Our findings reveal that brand likeability is positively associated with satisfaction and positive word of mouth. The scale extends existing branding research, providing brand managers with a metric so that likeability can be managed strategically. It addresses the need for firms to act more likeably in an interaction-dominated economy. Focusing on likeability acts as a differentiator and encourages likeable brand personality traits.

The tensile and compression testing showed high values of ultimate tensile stresses (UTS) and compressive peak stresses, both of which were above 300. MPa at temperatures up to 250 °C. At temperatures higher than 250 °C, the peak stresses rapidly decreased. The fatigue experiments indicated that the fatigue lives were not sensitive to temperatures between 25 and 300 °C. The fatigue limit was between 50 and 75. MPa. The creep experiments suggested that in the applied stress range of 30-120. MPa the dominant secondary creep deformation mechanism was dislocation climb. The dense distribution of precipitating prismatic particles in the matrix of the magnesium solid solution aided the creep resistance. In the lower-temperature and lower-applied stress creep regime (e.g. longer creep life), intensive creep cavitation was observed at the grain boundaries in the form of cavitated grain facets and a high fraction of cavitated boundaries (∼45%). In the higher-temperature and higher-stress creep regime, failure occurred in the form of mixed grain boundary cavitation and cracking. In both cases the preferred cavity and crack nucleation sites were particles of secondary phases situated on the grain boundaries or triple junctions.',\n",

Innovation covariance matrix (ICM) of AEKF is estimated by fixed-length error innovation sequence (EIS) (the difference between measured and estimated voltages), which doesn't consider the distribution change of EIS. However, the distribution of EIS will change due to load current dynamics or error of battery model. Failing to consider the distribution change of EIS will lead to SOC estimation inaccuracy. To address this problem, this paper proposed an intelligent adaptive extended Kalman filter (IAEKF) method that can detect the moment of distribution change of EIS by the maximum likelihood function. Then, the ICM is updated based on the EIS after that moment to improve the SOC estimation accuracy. Results show that the proposed IAEKF method improves SOC estimation accuracy. Compared to that of the AEKF, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of SOC based on IAEKF decrease significantly by 43.34% and 55.80%, respectively, while the computation time only increases by 4.59%. In the end, the effect of initial parameters on the SOC estimation accuracy was analysed. It is found that the proposed IAEKF method is robust against parameter uncertainties.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction and Objectives Activity monitors (i.e. apps and wearables) are becoming increasingly utilised by the general population and people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Adapting to COVID-19 involved the remote delivery of COPD treatments, including pulmonary rehabilitation. However, research prior to COVID-19 has reported that few healthcare practitioners used activity monitors within treatment and rarely discussed or reviewed patients’ activity data. Barriers to utilising patient activity data have included; time, expertise, and scepticism about the benefits of reviewing data. Understanding how healthcare practitioners can incorporate technology and utilise activity data collected at home could enable more effective remote delivery of interventions, healthcare, and treatment. This qualitative research aimed to explore healthcare practitioners’ views and experiences of supporting people with COPD who have used activity monitors.\\n\\nMethods Seventeen semi-structured telephone or online interviews were conducted with healthcare practitioners between September 2020 and May 2021. Healthcare practitioner occupations included nurse, occupational therapist, physician, and physiotherapist. Participants all had experience of supporting people with COPD who had used activity monitors. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.\\n\\nResults Five preliminary themes were developed underlining healthcare practitioners’ experiences of supporting patients with COPD using activity monitors; 1) Using skills and experience to increase accessibility, digital literacy and engagement, 2) The importance of discussion and dialogue to support patients with using activity monitors, 3) Using objectively monitored activity levels to encourage physical activity and support exercise prescription, 4) Implementation of research into usual care and applications to real life, and 5) Benefits of using activity monitors and their future potential.\\n\\nConclusions This study highlighted that HCPs recognise the potential for activity monitors to positively impact patients’ ability to self-manage their COPD. However, there is also a need for training, best practice guidelines and/or recommendations to support HCPs to engage with activity monitors. If physical activity data collected at home is utilised and integrated effectively and efficiently into healthcare practices to support COPD treatment, there is potential for activity monitors to positively impact patients‘ health and self-management behaviours',\n",

Overall test sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Cohen's Kappa statistic with 95% confidence interval ranges were calculated and compared, as well as sensitivities in detecting mild-moderate (0.5 ≤ ABPI < 0.9) and major (ABPI < 0.5) levels of PAD.Main results.CV with eitherk = 5 or 10 folds gave similar diagnostic performances. The overall test sensitivity was 86.6%, specificity 90.2% and accuracy 88.9% (Kappa: 0.76 [0.70-0.82]) (atk= 5). The sensitivity to mild-moderate disease was 83.0% (75.5%-88.9%) and to major disease was 100.0% (90.5%-100.0%).Significance.Substantial agreements have been demonstrated between the DL-based PPG classification technique and the ABPI PAD diagnostic reference. This novel automatic approach, requiring minimal pre-processing of the pulse waveforms before PPG trace classification, could offer significant benefits for the diagnosis of PAD in a variety of clinical settings where low-cost, portable and easy-to-use diagnostics are desirable.\",\n",

In our increasingly diverse societies, so the story goes, it is needed to implement a certain type of secularism and/or support particular types of secular standpoints in order to maintain a certain status quo that guarantees security, democracy, and equality for all. Religion is often perceived and simultaneously constructed in opposition to the emancipation and equal rights of women. This dominant logic, in which secularism and religion are opposites, makes it difficult for women of diverse religious–cultural backgrounds to cooperate on an equal footing for a shared feminist cause. However, feminist politics and practices that cross religious–secular divides can and do take place. Feminist research has so far paid little attention to the actualities of this feminist border-crossing and the transformations it may engender in our current sociopolitical context. In this article, I aim to offer a consideration of feminist politics and solidarity crossing religious–secular divides in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern region of Belgium. Through two case studies, I explore how cooperation and solidarity across religious–secular boundaries are developed and being talked about by activists. I argue that such feminist coalitions can and do directly and indirectly affect the public debates and inspire feminist thinking on issues regarding religion, secularism, and feminism in the multicultural society.',\n",

Physical activity can increase life expectancy, reduce hospital admission, and improve quality of life for people with COPD. Previous research has focussed on the use of activity monitors for monitoring physical activity, often as an objective research measure. However, understanding the experiences of people with COPD using monitoring technology in everyday life could support the development and delivery of effective interventions to increase activity levels. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of people with COPD using activity monitors at home in everyday life.\\n\\nMethods Seven semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted with people with COPD between August 2018 and June 2020. Eligible participants had all used apps and/or wearables (i.e., Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple Watch) to monitor their activity (e.g., steps, distance, heart rate) within the last year. Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).\\n\\nResults Four themes were developed using IPA demonstrating the positive and negative journey of engagement with activity monitors over time: 1) Motivational features to keep monitoring physical activity, 2) The importance of setting achievable goals to manage expectations of activity, 3) Development of knowledge and awareness of activity levels, and 4) Life with the tracker from ‘before’ to ‘now’.\\n\\nConclusions This study has provided a detailed insight into how people with COPD use apps and wearables to monitor their physical activity at home in everyday life.

       "  'abstract': 'Cycle life of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for the application of hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV). Since temperature greatly affects degradation rate and safety of LIBs, battery thermal management system (BTMS) is required. In this paper, the performance of active air cooling and passive phase change material (PCM) cooling for BTMS are assessed in terms of battery thermal states and cycle life. A coupled one-dimensional electrochemical and two-dimensional thermal models are developed to simulate the temperature of a battery module with 16 cylindrical (26650) graphite-LiFePO4 lithium-ion battery cells. The model is validated with the experimental data taken from literature. By applying a realistic current profile of a HEV to the battery model, simulations are performed at various ambient temperatures, inlet velocities of air cooling and PCM phase change temperatures. The battery cycle life and its non-uniformity across the module are estimated with a battery degradation model with inputs of battery temperature results. The study shows that active air cooling has a better cooling effect than PCM cooling, especially at high ambient temperatures. But the active air cooling leads to a large temperature non-uniformity at low inlet air velocities. The cycle life of the battery module under air cooling is longer than that of PCM cooling, although a larger life non-uniformity is observed. Furthermore, two methods are compared by a newly proposed evaluation index called cyclical cost. This index considers both the battery cycle life and the parasitic power consumption of the BTMS. The result demonstrates that air cooling has a lower cyclical cost than PCM cooling. When the inlet velocity of the air cooling system increases, the cyclical cost has a trend of decreasing first and then increasing. This paper provides a guide for the development of BTMS to further prolong the cycle life and reduce total operating cost of LIBs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction Nationally, high quality, translational research that has a tangible impact on lives and outcomes is demanded by service users, commissioners and research funders (NIHR, 2013). However, without strong leadership firmly embedded within health organisations the impact on children’s nursing remains limited in reaching its potential. Aim This presentation will critically review the experiences of employing an innovative leadership approach to progress children’s nursing research and evidence-based practice (EBP) culture, capacity and capability within a children’s hospital, situated within a large NHS Trust. Methods Despite demonstrable commitment from the senior nursing management, local implementation of the nursing research vision remained under-developed. Consequently, a local strategy that engaged key stakeholders and PPI was devised during 2013/4 to operationalise the vision within the children’s hospital. An innovative approach was employed to fulfil this multifaceted and diverse remit. Results Outputs to date included identifying research areas that aligned to local and national service priorities; the appointment of a clinical-academic children’s nurse; the implementation of a training programme in knowledge translation and scholarly activities; and a funded partnership between a senior children’s nursing research leader/professor and the healthcare organisation. Opportunities have been sought with potential for national multi-centre studies with other specialist children’s health settings. Post graduate students have been identified and supported. Conclusion The strategy employed contributes to transforming the children’s nursing research and EBP culture within a healthcare organisation in the UK through an innovative leadership approach. This visionary strategy will be shared with delegates with the rationale for appointments and support, and there impact on organisational culture, outlined. Challenges and successes will be discussed including early exemplars and high level impact results. The results and presentation will be useful for all delegates in supporting and developing the culture of nursing research within healthcare organisations.',\n",

This transition from an older regime of industrial manufacturing to a new regime of finance, real estate, and risk-mediated transactions has resulted into new socio-spatial and cultural formations. New York fiction itself has tackled these changes, and an extraordinary exemplar of such literature is Jay McInerney's Brightness Falls (1992). The present article is the outcome of interdisciplinary “field work” that combines analyses of fictional, nonfictional, and critical writing, archival research, geographical, cultural, and political theories. More specifically, this fine-grained critique of the novel and its satellite writings deals with the emerging relationship between the arts and the new FIRE economy, manifest through relations of power in the market place, with consequences upon authorial and publishing practices, rhetoric, and the discourses of everyday life.\",\n",

Drawing on survey data, this article explores the religious and spiritual views of 1,265 third-wave feminists, most of whom are female and in their twenties and thirties. Comparison with surveys of religious adherence in the UK reveals that these feminists are significantly less religious and somewhat more spiritual than the general population.

The chapter is the first to explicitly trace connections between computers and dance back to the 1960s when early computer artists, often mathematicians and computer scientists by training, were experimenting with ways the computer could support creative processes. The chapter focuses on the work of a select number of individuals, for example A. Michael Noll and John Lansdown, whose seminal contributions provided a historical backdrop to the Software for Dancers (SFD) initiative in 2001. With funding from Arts Council England, SFD was a six-month research project involved a handful of leading UK choreographers coming together with digital artists and designers “to develop concepts for a software rehearsal tool(s) for choreographers and those practitioners for whom the body in motion is a primary material.” Several current practice-based interdisciplinary projects funded by AHRC, EU and other sources and many articles and conference papers can be traced directly back this early research project, which this chapter provides a specific history for. The anthology itself has had very wide distribution and visibility as it features thirty-six essays, interviews, and artist statements on the impact of “remix” o creative practice of writers, musicians and artists and includes contributions from many well-known practitioners including Pierre Boulez, Pauline Oliver, Brian Eno, Steve Reich, Cory Doctorow as well as scholars/ writers such as Erik Davis, Catherine Corman, Manuel DeLanda, Frances Dyson, Jonathan Lethem, Hans Ulrich Obrist and Bruce Sterling.

Research was conducted from 2004 to 2010 on four farms in the North West Province, interviewing farmworkers and farm owners. Representatives of the agricultural union Agri North West and land analysts were interviewed to obtain their perspective on farm labour. Despite protective legislation, farmworkers' living and working conditions have deteriorated. Farmworkers further lack alternative livelihood options, perpetuating their dependency on farm owners, who are the only ones providing services and some social security. Among the main barriers in the empowerment of farmworkers are limited insights regarding complex social relationships on farms, the challenge to address the specificity of power relations, and the marginalised position of farmworkers and their lack of agency in the broader political system. Both farmworkers and farm owners need support structures and strengthened institutional capacity to gradually change power dynamics.\",\n",

It takes into account the severe data-limitations and provides the best possible approximation for its long-term electrical, thermal and ageing performance. This is achieved by constructing flexible and scalable ageing models from experimental data based on manufacturer's datasheets, warranties and manuals as key inputs. The precision of the individual models has been determined using experimental data and has been found with <8 % normalised root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD) in all cases to be sufficiently accurate. Through linearization methods, this model is able to compare the long-term performance of BESS and quantify the degradative impact of specific charge/discharge mission profiles, which improves the tangibility of BESS as value generating asset.\",\n",

While there is a greater need to understand these two customer groups, few studies examine the impact of customer engagement tactics on the two customer groups, focusing on their perceptual differences. Even less attention is given to customer engagement tactics in a cross-cultural framework. In this research, the authors investigate customers in China and UK, aiming to compare their perceptual differences on the impact of multiple customer engagement tactics. Design/methodology/approach – Using a quantitative approach with 286 usable responses from China and the UK obtained through a combination of person-administered survey and computer-based survey screening process, the authors test a series of hypotheses to distinguish across-cultural differences. Findings – Findings show that the collectivists (Chinese customers) perceive customer engagement tactics differently than the individualists (UK customers). The Chinese customers are more sensitive to price and reputation, whereas the UK customers respond more strongly to service, communication and customisation. Chinese customers’ concerns with extensive price and reputation comparisons may be explained by their awareness towards face (status), increased self-expression and equality. Practical implications – The findings challenge the conventional practice of using similar customer engagement tactics for a specific market place with little concern for multiple cultural backgrounds. The paper proposes strategies for marketers facing challenges in this globalised context. Originality/value – Several contributions have been made to the literatures. First, the study showed the effects of culture on the customers’ perceptual differences. Second, the study provided more information to clarify customers’ different reactions towards customer engagement tactics, highlighted by concerns towards face and status. Third, the study provided empirical evidence to support the use of multiple customer engagement tactics to the across cultural studies.',\n",

Tensile creep tests were performed at 300°C up to the final fracture. Several tests at 50 MPa were interrupted after reaching the steady state creep; and another set of creep tests was interrupted after the onset of ternary creep. Fraction of cavitated dendritic boundaries was evaluated using optical microscopy. Measurement of grain boundary sliding by observation of the offset of marker lines was carried out on the surface of the crept specimens after the test interruption by scanning electron microscopy and by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results show that the dominant creep mechanism in this alloy is dislocation creep with minor contribution of the grain boundary sliding. Creep failure took place by the nucleation, growth and coalescence of creep cavities on the boundaries predominantly oriented perpendicular to the applied stress. Increasing amount of cavitated boundaries with time of creep exposure supports the mechanism of continuous cavity nucleation and growth.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Conducting research into young learner experiences of school poses methodological challenges which are compounded when, as is increasingly the case, the classroom interaction is multilingual and the research methods are participatory (Maguire 2005; Pinter 2014). Each new or adapted method sheds further light on the issues that can arise. Researcher Initiated Role Play (Yaacob and Gardner 2012) is a method where a researcher invites a group of children to engage in role play, something that many young children do spontaneously. This gives children the interactional space to take control of the specifics of the role play and to present their perspectives and concerns through multiple semiotic layers. This paper explores ethical issues that arise when role play reveals familiar but occluded practices; practices that are not readily presented to outsiders. Specifically, when this Researcher Initiated Role Play was used to explore how children in their first years of school learn to read in different languages and in different multilingual, primary school contexts, certain occluded disciplinary practices were revealed. This paper considers the nature of an ethical response to such revelations.

We used ethnicity identification software to test effects of psychological beliefs about screening as mediators of ethnicity and SES on faecal occult blood colorectal screening behavior in a no-cost health care context. Method: Adults aged 50–67 years (N = 1,678), of whom 28% were from minority South Asian religiolinguistic ethnic groups (Hindu-Gujarati/Hindi, Muslim-Urdu and Sikh-Punjabi), participated in a prospective survey study. Subsequent screening participation was determined from medical records. Results: Screening nonparticipation in the most deprived SES quintile was 1.6 times that of the least deprived quintile. Nonparticipation was 1.6 times higher in South Asians compared with non-Asians. A process model in which psychological variables mediated effects of ethnicity and SES on uptake was tested using structural equation modeling. Self-efficacy and perceived psychological costs of screening were, respectively, positive and negative direct predictors of uptake. Paths from Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh ethnicity, and SES on uptake were fully mediated by lower self-efficacy and higher perceived psychological costs. Paths from South Asian ethnicity to participation via self-efficacy and psychological costs were direct, and indirect via SES. Conclusion: SES is implicated, but does not fully account for low colorectal screening uptake among South Asians. Targeting increased self-efficacy and reduced perceived psychological costs may minimize health inequality effects. Future research should test independent effects of SES and ethnicity on lower self-efficacy and higher psychological costs.',\n",

The aim of this meta-synthesis was to examine women’s experiences of POI both before and after diagnosis to provide new understandings of those experiences. Design: A systematic review of ten studies examining women’s experiences of POI. Results: Using thematic synthesis, three analytical themes were identified, demonstrating the complexity of experiences of women diagnosed with POI: ‘What is happening to me?’, ‘Who am I?’ and ‘Who can help me?’. Women experience profound changes and losses associated with their identity that they must adjust to. Women also experience an incongruence between their identity as a young woman and that of a menopausal woman. Difficulty was also experienced accessing support pre-and post-diagnosis of POI, which could hinder coping with and adjustment to the diagnosis. Conclusion: Women require adequate access to support following diagnosis of POI. Further training should be provided to health care professionals not only on POI but including the importance of psychological support for women with POI and the resources available to provide the much needed emotional and social support.',\n",

Filtering can distort the morphology of the original PPG signal waveform and change the timing of pulse feature points on PPG signals.Weaim to quantitatively investigate the effect of PPG signal morphology (related to measurement site) and type of pulse feature on the filtering-induced time shift (TS). Approach. 60 s PPG signals were measured from six body sites (finger, wrist under (volar), wrist upper (dorsal), earlobe, and forehead) of 36 healthy adults. Using infinite impulse response digital filters which are common in PPG signal processing, PPG signals were prefiltered (band-pass, pass and stop bands:>0.5 Hz and<0.2 Hz for high-pass filter,<20 Hz and>30 Hz for low-pass filter) and then filtered (low-pass, pass and stop bands:<3Hz and>5Hz). Four pulse feature points were defined and extracted (peak, valley, maximal first derivative, and maximal second derivative). For each subject, overall TS and intra-subject TS variability in feature points were calculated as the mean and standard deviation of TS between prefiltered and filtered PPG signals in 50 cardiac cycles. Statistical testing was performed to investigate the effect of measurement site and type of pulse feature on overall TS and intra-subject TS variability. Main results. Measurement site, type of pulse feature, and their interaction had significant impacts on the overall TS and intra-subject TS variability (p?<?0.001 for all). Valley and maximal second derivative showed higher overall TS than peak and maximal first derivative. Finger had higher overall TS and lower intra-subject TS variability than other measurement sites. Significance. Measurement site and type of pulse feature can significantly influence the timing of feature points on filtered PPG signals. Filtering parameters should be quoted to support the reproducibility of PPG-related studies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: A high proportion of hypertensive patients remain above the target threshold for blood pressure, increasing the risk of adverse health outcomes. A digital intervention to facilitate healthcare practitioners (hereafter practitioners) to initiate planned medication escalations when patients’ home readings were raised was found to be effective in lowering blood pressure over 12 months. This mixed-methods process evaluation aimed to develop a detailed understanding of how the intervention was implemented in Primary Care, possible mechanisms of action and contextual factors influencing implementation. Methods: One hundred twenty-five practitioners took part in a randomised controlled trial, including GPs, practice nurses, nurse-prescribers, and healthcare assistants. Usage data were collected automatically by the digital intervention and antihypertensive medication changes were recorded from the patients’ medical notes. A sub-sample of 27 practitioners took part in semi-structured qualitative process interviews. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and the quantitative data using descriptive statistics and correlations to explore factors related to adherence. The two sets of findings were integrated using a triangulation protocol. Results: Mean practitioner adherence to escalating medication was moderate (53%), and the qualitative analysis suggested that low trust in home readings and the decision to wait for more evidence influenced implementation for some practitioners. The logic model was partially supported in that self-efficacy was related to adherence to medication escalation, but qualitative findings provided further insight into additional potential mechanisms, including perceived necessity and concerns. Contextual factors influencing implementation included proximity of average readings to the target threshold. Meanwhile, adherence to delivering remote support was mixed, and practitioners described some uncertainty when they received no response from patients. Conclusions: This mixed-methods process evaluation provided novel insights into practitioners’ decision-making around escalating medication using a digital algorithm. Implementation strategies were proposed which could benefit digital interventions in addressing clinical inertia, including facilitating tracking of patients’ readings over time to provide stronger evidence for medication escalation, and allowing more flexibility in decision-making whilst discouraging clinical inertia due to borderline readings. Implementation of one-way notification systems could be facilitated by enabling patients to send a brief acknowledgement response. Trial registration: (ISRCTN13790648). Registered 14 May 2015.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"How does literary production respond to processes of urbanization? What do literary and cultural representations tell us about urban communities and practices? Guided by these questions, Urban Space and Late Twentieth-Century New York Literature theorizes literary geography anew by examining writers' responses to the uneven development of New York City. Catalina Neculai offers a rich critique of literature written during the consolidation of the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) industry in the 1970s and 1980s. Whether it is about the culture industries, gentrification, housing movements, or the finance economy, here New York literature becomes akin to urban fieldwork that produces knowledge of space and engages with the politics of place. Interdisciplinary in conception and design, the book draws on fiction, non-fiction, grassroots narratives, archival material, radical Marxist geography, urban politics, and urban history.\",\n",

Material from the movement’s public discourse and participant observation and interviews in a local congregation are examined to explore how these Christians understand and practise fatherhood. Like evangelicals in the US, Newfrontiers combine older ideas about responsible, breadwinner fatherhood with new concepts of emotionally-involved fathering. Like American evangelicals, they aim to maintain biblical values while embracing contemporary culture in order to be relevant to society. What is noticeable is that despite the more traditional ideals their leaders advocate, evangelical congregations’ fatherhood ideals and practices are very similar to those of mainstream UK society. Thus the article concludes that mainstream culture is exercising a greater influence on British evangelicals than theology.',\n",

We developed a complex online clinical and public health intervention, the eSexual Health Clinic (eSHC), in which patients with genital chlamydia are diagnosed and medically managed via an automated online clinical consultation, leading to antibiotic collection from a pharmacy. Partner notification, health promotion, and capture of surveillance data are integral aspects of the eSHC. We aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of the eSHC as an alternative to routine care in non-randomised, exploratory proof-of-concept studies.\\n\\nMethods\\nParticipants were untreated patients with chlamydia from genitourinary medicine clinics, untreated patients with chlamydia from six areas in England in the National Chlamydia Screening Programme's (NCSP) online postal testing service, or patients without chlamydia tested in the same six NCSP areas. All participants were aged 16 years or older. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with chlamydia who consented to the online chlamydia pathway who then received appropriate clinical management either exclusively through online treatment or via a combination of online management and face-to-face care. We captured adverse treatment outcomes.\\n\\nFindings\\nBetween July 21, 2014, and March 13, 2015, 2340 people used the eSHC. Of 197 eligible patients from genitourinary medicine clinics, 161 accessed results online. Of the 116 who consented to be included in the study, 112 (97%, 95% CI 91–99) received treatment, and 74 of those were treated exclusively online. Of the 146 eligible NCSP patients, 134 accessed their results online, and 105 consented to be included. 93 (89%, 95% CI 81–94) received treatment, and 60 were treated exclusively online. In both groups, median time to collection of treatment was within 1 day of receiving their diagnosis. 1776 (89%) of 1936 NCSP patients without chlamydia accessed results online. No adverse events were recorded.\\n\\nInterpretation\\nThe eSHC is safe and feasible for management of patients with chlamydia, with preliminary evidence of similar treatment outcomes to those in traditional services. This innovative model could help to address growing clinical and public health needs. A definitive trial is needed to assess the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and public health impact of this intervention.\\n\\nFunding\\nUK Clinical Research Collaboration.\",\n",

This is becoming increasingly important as the energy and power densities demanded by batteries and the economic costs of packs increase. Here, ultrasonic time-of-flight analysis is performed to demonstrate the technique as a tool for the identification of a range of defects and SoH in Li-ion cells. Analysis of large, purpose-built defects across multiple length scales is performed in pouch cells. The technique is then demonstrated to detect a microscale defect in a commercial cell, which is validated by examining the acoustic transmission signal through the cell. The location and scale of the defects are confirmed using X-ray computed tomography, which also provides information pertaining to the layered structure of the cells. The demonstration of this technique as a methodology for obtaining direct, non-destructive, depth-resolved measurements of the condition of electrode layers highlights the potential application of acoustic methods in real-time diagnostics for SoH monitoring and manufacturing processes.',\n",

UK guidelines recommend that LC symptoms be managed pragmatically with holistic support for patients' biopsychosocial needs, including psychological, emotional, and physical health. Self-management strategies, such as pacing, prioritization, and goal setting, are vital for the self-management of many LC symptoms.\\n\\nObjective\\nThis paper describes the codevelopment and initial testing of a digital intervention combining peer support with positive psychology approaches for self-managing the physical, emotional, psychological, and cognitive challenges associated with LC. The objectives of this study were to (1) codesign an intervention with and for people with LC; (2) test the intervention and study methods; (3) measure changes in participant well-being, self-efficacy, fatigue, and loneliness; and (4) understand the types of self-management goals and strategies used by people with LC.\\n\\nMethods\\nThe study used a pre-post, mixed methods, pragmatic, uncontrolled design. Digital intervention content was codeveloped with a lived-experience group to meet the needs uncovered during the intervention development and logic mapping phase.

The tensile creep tests were performed at 300 °C and constant load in the stress range 30-80 MPa. The minimum creep rate over(ε{lunate}, ̇)min, as a function of the stress, follows a power law with the exponent n = 5.9 at 30-70 MPa. The time to fracture tf is also a power function of the stress with an exponent m = -4.4. The modified Monkman-Grant relation is valid. Microstructure development during creep exposure of the MgY3Nd2Zn1Mn1 alloy suggests the low stacking fault energy as the main creep controlling factor. The alloy is superior to the WE43 alloy both in time to fracture and in the minimum creep rate about one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. Both the mean value of the modified Monkman-Grant constant and its scatter correspond to the model of constrained growth of cavities along dendrite boundaries.',\n",

IR is thought to update unhelpful schema by addressing the needs of the younger self within the memory. An accumulating body of evidence indicates that by modifying NSI, IR can significantly affect distressing imagery, memory appraisal, and beliefs about the self. Aims: This systematic review aims to critically evaluate and synthesise literature investigating the existing research on the effects IR has on NSI in SAD. Method: A systematic electronic search of Academic Search Complete, ProQuest, Medline, Scopus and PubMed was performed in February 2021 using pre-defined criteria. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Results: Analysis of the reviewed articles' findings identified three main themes: Changes to negative self-images, Memories linked to images and Encapsulated beliefs. IR was associated with significant decreases in image distress, image vividness, memory vividness, memory distress, and encapsulated beliefs. Although reductions were found with image frequency, they were non-significant. Interpretation of results is limited by the small number of studies. Conclusions: IR appears to effectively alter images, memories and beliefs in SAD in as little as a single session. The findings indicate that IR could be utilised as a cost-effective intervention for SAD. However, additional studies and longer-term follow-ups are needed.\",\n",

Nevertheless, research trying to understand what are the determinants and outcomes of it is still limited. Using semi-structured interviews and projective techniques, this work identifies that self-congruity, experience, responsiveness, quality, reputation and trust are found to be the determinants of strong brand attachment. The outcomes of brand attachment are intention to recommend, purchase, revisit, resilience to negative information and act of defending the brand. This research sheds light for marketers in understanding the conceptualisation of attachment from the consumers' perspectives, so adopting an important perspective largely under-researched.

       "  'abstract': 'In the present work, SS 304 sheet of 200 μm thickness was used to experimentally evaluate the forming limit diagram (FLD). In this context, a sub-size limiting dome height (LDH) test setup was developed to deform rectangular specimens of different widths using a 30 mm hemispherical punch. Further, effect of various parameters such as change in circular grid size, stretching direction with respect to rolling direction of the sheet, punch size and deformation speed on limiting strains was investigated. It was observed that there was marginal change in limiting strains due to the change of punch diameter from 30 mm to 50 mm. The FLD 0 level changed approximately 7.5% and 6.8% with the change in punch diameter and stretching direction respectively. It was also found that the FLD 0 value increased by 15% with change in circular grid diameter from 2.5 mm to 2.0 mm. However, a negligible change in the limiting strains was noted when the grid diameter was further reduced to 1.0 mm. There was negligible change in the FLD 0 level with increase in punch speed from 4 mm/min to 100 mm/min, but approximately 13% decrease was found when the punch speed was further increased to 400 mm/min. Moreover, the LDH, strain distribution and failure strains were also analyzed in context of formability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rationale: In England, the Department of Health has made reducing the rates of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) a priority, particularly amongst young people who are disproportionately affected. The best way for sexually active people to avoid STIs is to use a condom but young people report inconsistent use. A missed opportunity to intervene to increase condom use is when they access self-testing kits for STIs via the internet. On average 130,000 young people are tested via this route every year in England. Those tested are at high risk of future STIs and include groups which other services have found difficult to engage, such as young men and those from deprived backgrounds. Typically however, these websites provide little or no sexual health promotion.\\n\\nAims: This study aimed to develop a theory-based, tailored intervention to increase condom use for young people aged 15-24 years accessing chlamydia self-testing websites.\\n\\nMethodology: The intervention (Wrapped) was co-designed with young people to maximise future appeal and use by the target audience. Development followed guidance from the Medical Research Council (MRC) on developing complex behaviour change interventions. The following steps were performed: 1) identification of important determinants of condom use and evidence of their ‘changeability’ using computer/digital interventions, 2) identification of suitable Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), and engaging methods of delivery, to target these determinants , 3) design of the tailored intervention ensuring fidelity to theoretical basis and high levels of appeal/usability.\\n\\nAnalysis: Not applicable\\n\\nResults: The resulting intervention is to be embedded within existing chlamydia self-testing websites as part of the user pathway. It uses a ‘recommender system’ to identify users’ salient barriers to condom use and to present relevant components of the intervention to target these. Components are delivered over a period of days in between the request for a chlamydia self-testing kit and provision of the result. The components include: provision of a selection of condoms/lubricant and instructions for identifying preferred type(s), easy access to preferred condom(s)/lubricant through a discrete delivery service, video demonstration of eroticized condom application, real sex videos showing condom use, talking heads of other young people discussing how to communicate wish to use condoms, and provision of condom storage/carrying product.\\n\\nConclusions: this tailored intervention will be directed at young people who may be particularly receptive to messages and support for behaviour change due to their testing status. The content of this intervention makes a deliberate attempt to target cognitive processes relating to both system one (emotional, instinctive, responds to needs – basic urges and drives) and two (analytical, controlled, rational, can plan ahead). Next steps are to run a feasibility study and then a full trial of the intervention to establish its efficacy.',\n",

Insight into patients’ experiences of monitoring physical activity is needed to inform future healthcare practice and policy utilizing this technology to support long-term positive health behavior change. This scoping review aimed to explore the experiences of using technology for monitoring physical activity among people with COPD. The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodological framework was used. Relevant scientific databases (CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library and Scopus) were searched from 1st January 2016 to 16th March 2021. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the data. Twelve studies exploring the experiences of people with COPD using technology for monitoring physical activity were included in the synthesis. Seven themes were developed and summarize experiences: 1) Monitoring and keeping track of their activity and health, 2) Supporting motivation to be active, 3) Acceptability of the device, 4) Experiencing technical issues with the device, 5) Setting appropriate and achievable goals for their health condition, 6) Integrating the device into their life and daily routine, and 7) Perceived physical and psychological benefits of using the device. Further high-quality research is needed to understand the experiences of people with COPD using technology to monitor physical activity in everyday life and better self-manage their health condition. Supporting people with COPD to monitor their physical activity could enable them to better self-manage their health condition.',\n",

Multiple methods included focus groups, face-to-face and telephone interviews and participatory activities.

Whilst children and young people expressed ideas related to quality of environment, services and social life, professionals focused on ways of meeting the families’ needs. The theme that linked families’ concerns with those of professionals was ‘assessing individual needs’. Two questions to be addressed by the evaluation are (1) to what extent are services designed to meet the needs of children and families and (2) to what extent are children, young people and their families consulted about what they need?

The study explores how customizing offers to match customers’ individual needs and how treating customers differentially provoke unfairness perceptions among those not being considered most important. While the literature discusses unfairness perceptions of pricing, promotion, and service, less is known about unfairness in customization practices.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach\\n– Using a survey approach, 443 completed questionnaires we collected. Following validation of our item measures, a hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to test the conceptual model and hypothesized linkages between our constructs.\\n\\nFindings\\n– The results demonstrate that customers’ negative perceptions of customization increase their unfairness perceptions. Unfairness perceptions drastically reduce customer loyalty intentions with trust acting as a significant moderator. Trust increases loyalty intentions even when unfairness perceptions are present. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding how firms may improve their perceived fairness. This increase in perceived fairness creates positive attributions, reduces negative customer experience perceptions and increases loyalty intentions.\\n\\nOriginality/value\\n– Key contribution is the development and validation of a conceptual model explaining the linkages between firm customization and unfairness perceptions, firm customization and customer loyalty intentions and the moderating role of trust between these relationships.

It has only been possible due to exact analysis of stress-vs.-strain curves and the determination of supposed value for fracture-strain of oxide film at crack tip, f.

In this article, I aim to demonstrate the multiplicity and complexity of several recent secular feminist responses to increasing religious diversity and the activism of Muslim women in the context of Belgium – a society that is part of postcolonial Europe and is characterized by a specific religious–secular landscape. I argue that the diverging ways in which secular feminists approach Islam and the activism of Muslim women point at a controversy among white secular feminists about religion – that is situated within and reconfiguring the local religious–secular landscape through its (re)constructions of feminist secularities.\",\n",

Prior university wide taxonomies of student writing have relied on intuition, the opinions of faculty, or data from course documentation and task prompts. In contrast, our classification is grounded in analysis of all 2858 BAWE (British Academic Written English) corpus texts actually produced by undergraduate and taught postgraduate university students in England for assessment purposes. This builds on the American tradition of classifying university student writing tasks (e.g. Horowitz 1986; Hale et al. 1996; Melzer 2009) and the very different Australian tradition of classifying primary and secondary school children’s written texts as genres (e.g. Martin and Rothery 1986; Coffin 2006). Understanding our classification of 13 genre families enables more meaningful interrogation of the BAWE corpus by teachers and researchers. The diversity in student genres across disciplines and levels of study is noteworthy for academic writing materials developers and all interested in the nature of higher education.',\n",

In wrought special brass alloys, reducing the content of this alloying element or replacing it with alternative alloying additions may give rise to a new type of machinable copper alloys which differ from the original alloys by their contents of other modifier elements such as Si (or possibly, Mg, Bi, and P). These alloys have a very low content of lead required for the break-up of chips during machining. Even though these types of brass exhibit a very good machinability, the effects of their chemical composition on the resistance of the alloy to corrosion cracking have not yet been given sufficient attention. This paper aims to present an assessment of three new types of machinable copper alloys regarding their susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking, in comparison to that of the lead-alloyed variety, in 0.05 M NaCl, NaNO2, and Na2SO4 solutions. The slow strain rate test has been used for this purpose, and its results were correlated with metallographic evaluation of the number and depth of the cracks observed on the test specimen surfaces on completion of the test.',\n",

Setting and participants Retrospective analysis of prescribing patterns in 616 LTC institutions (31\\u2005619 residents) following launch of the NDS, using information from electronic medicines management system. Primary and secondary outcome measures Antipsychotic prescribing point prevalence (PP) for all residents in a cross section of LTC settings over a 4-year period following NDS launch. Secondary outcomes included dosages, length of treatment and use of recommended second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) versus first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). Associations between facility-level PP values and institutional characteristics, resident demographics were explored. Variations across geographical areas examined. Prescription net ingredient costs calculated. Results No statistically significant difference was observed in overall prescribing rates over the 4-year period (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test p=0.60), and there was no significant shift towards newer SGAs (KS test p=0.32).

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction and Objectives Activity monitors (i.e. apps and wearables) are becoming increasingly utilised by the general population and people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Adapting to COVID-19 involved the remote delivery of COPD treatments, including pulmonary rehabilitation. However, research prior to COVID-19 has reported that few healthcare practitioners used activity monitors within treatment and rarely discussed or reviewed patients’ activity data. Barriers to utilising patient activity data have included; time, expertise, and scepticism about the benefits of reviewing data. Understanding how healthcare practitioners can incorporate technology and utilise activity data collected at home could enable more effective remote delivery of interventions, healthcare, and treatment. This qualitative research aimed to explore healthcare practitioners’ views and experiences of supporting people with COPD who have used activity monitors.\\n\\nMethods Seventeen semi-structured telephone or online interviews were conducted with healthcare practitioners between September 2020 and May 2021. Healthcare practitioner occupations included nurse, occupational therapist, physician, and physiotherapist. Participants all had experience of supporting people with COPD who had used activity monitors. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.\\n\\nResults Five preliminary themes were developed underlining healthcare practitioners’ experiences of supporting patients with COPD using activity monitors; 1) Using skills and experience to increase accessibility, digital literacy and engagement, 2) The importance of discussion and dialogue to support patients with using activity monitors, 3) Using objectively monitored activity levels to encourage physical activity and support exercise prescription, 4) Implementation of research into usual care and applications to real life, and 5) Benefits of using activity monitors and their future potential.\\n\\nConclusions This study highlighted that HCPs recognise the potential for activity monitors to positively impact patients’ ability to self-manage their COPD. However, there is also a need for training, best practice guidelines and/or recommendations to support HCPs to engage with activity monitors. If physical activity data collected at home is utilised and integrated effectively and efficiently into healthcare practices to support COPD treatment, there is potential for activity monitors to positively impact patients‘ health and self-management behaviours',\n",

An approach based on plane strain analysis within the context of Interface Cohesive Zone Model (ICZM) was cited and presented as viable for describing and predicting delamination mode of failure in bonded concrete overlays systems (BCOs). The study shows that the use of numerical computational tools is vital in resolving the manifold complexity associated with interfacial delamination problems. In the concluding analytical model, it is evident that the numerical values of the delamination failure coefficient(D) and the corresponding Mixed-Mode energy release rates (G) vary depending on the overlay structural scale, the type of problem (plane stress or plane strain) and the degree of mismatched properties between the overlay and the substrate.',\n",

At present, it is not fully understood to what extent COVID-19 impacts cardiovascular function in the short- and long-term following infection. The aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to define the effect of COVID-19 on cardiovascular function (i.e. arterial stiffness, cardiac systolic and diastolic function) in otherwise healthy individuals and (ii) to evaluate the effect of a home-based physical activity intervention on cardiovascular function in people with a history of COVID-19.\\nMETHODS: This prospective, single-centre, observational study will recruit 120 COVID-19-vaccinated adult participants aged between 50 and 85 years, i.e. 80 with a history of COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls without a history of COVID-19. All participants will undergo baseline assessments including 12-lead electrocardiography, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, rest and stress echocardiography with speckle tracking imaging, spirometry, maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 7-day physical activity and sleep measures and quality of life questionnaires. Blood samples will be collected to assess the microRNA expression profiles, cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, i.e. cardiac troponin T; N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide; tumour necrosis factor alpha; interleukins 1, 6 and 10; C-reactive protein; D-dimer; and vascular endothelial growth factors. Following baseline assessments, COVID-19 participants will be randomised 1:1 into a 12-week home-based physical activity intervention aiming to increase their daily number of steps by 2000 from baseline. The primary outcome is change in left ventricular global longitudinal strain. Secondary outcomes are arterial stiffness, systolic and diastolic function of the heart, functional capacity, lung function, sleep measures, quality of life and well-being (depression, anxiety, stress and sleep efficiency).\\nDISCUSSION: The study will provide insights into the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 and their malleability with a home-based physical activity intervention.\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05492552.

       "  'abstract': 'When students write Case Study assignments at university, they face the demands of the academy and of the profession. This paper explores the choices successful students of Business and Medicine make to meet these competing demands at the levels of genre, register and language. In Case Study genres individual cases, such as a specific company or a patient, are analysed using frameworks accepted within the relevant disciplines. In our classification (Gardner and Nesi 2013), which was developed through analysis of the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus of successful student writing, Case Study genres also include a recommendation stage. This paper identifies five genres along a pedagogic to professional continuum. It shows how their registers are shaped by the institutional practices of the discipline (Field), by the competing student and professional roles of the writer (Tenor) and by the action orientation of the text (Mode). Wordings of recommendations retrieved through corpus analysis and interpreted from Systemic Functional Linguistic perspectives as choices within systems bring to light the multifaceted nature of recommendations, as well as disciplinary differences in their prosody and ownership. This study will be of interest to those involved in teaching academic writing, as well as those seeking to understand how professional roles and contexts are construed in texts.',\n",

This is achieved using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and a novel method of identifying and defining the threshold frequency between pseudo-capacitive and diffusion processes of the cell. It is found that this threshold frequency is independent of current intensity up to 1 C, showing that even at high power, pseudo-capacitance has significant impact. However, a severe dependency upon relative cell surface area and State of Charge (SoC) is identified. Symmetrical charge-discharge pulses of up to 10 s utilise primarily cell capacitance. Literature indicates, that this level of utilisation reduces the electrochemical ageing impact significantly. This article displays a method to identify and isolate these processes for any given cell and to allow enhancement of conventional ageing modelling.',\n",

The tensile creep tests were performed at constant load in the stress range 30 to 80 MPa and at 300oC. In the stress range 30 to 70 MPa, the minimum creep rate (ε/t)min is a function of the stress which follows a power law with an exponent n = 5.89. The time to fracture tf is also a power function of the stress with an exponent m = - 4.39. The modified Monkman-Grant relation can be expressed by the equation tf/(εf − εp).(ε/t)min1.0001 = 0.57, where εf is the strain at fracture and εp is the strain of primary creep. Both the mean value of the modified Monkman-Grant and its scatter (determined for the particular stress values in the Monkman-Grant relation at unity value of the exponent) correspond to the model of constrained growth of cavities along dendrite boundaries. The creep damage consisting in initiation, growth and coalescence of cavities at dendrite boundaries was monitored by light microscopy observation of the surface of creep test pieces and metallographic samples prepared in planes parallel with test pieces axis, and by fractographic studies of fracture surfaces of broken creep specimens using scanning electron microscopy. In addition, our results proved the validity of the relation between the time to fracture tf and the time necessary to achieve the Monkman-Grant elongation tMGD= tf.(ε/t)min consistent with the model of continuous creep damage.',\n",

Scholars consider brand attachment a key requisite in consumer-brand relationships that create favourable consumer behaviours such as positive brand attitudes and brand loyalty. Few studies, however, examine the detrimental outcomes of brand attachment. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework that explores how brand attachment may explain detrimental consumer behaviours, such as oppositional brand loyalty and antibrand actions. We investigate consumers' trash-talking and schadenfreude in brand communities and their subsequent outcomes. Our framework reveals that the link between brand attachment and oppositional brand loyalty is driven by consumers' social identity and sense of rivalry. Furthermore, we put forward that brand attachment leads to anti-brand actions when relationships deteriorate. We identify two factors behind the deterioration: (1) companies' opportunism activities, and (2) incongruity between consumers' values and the brand's values. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed arising from our emerging 'dark side' brand attachment framework.\",\n",

In the United Kingdom, 2 film readers independently evaluate each mammogram to search for signs of cancer and examine digital mammograms in batches. However, a vigilance decrement (reduced detection rate with time on task) has been observed in similar settings. Objective To determine the effect of changing the order for the second film reader of batches of screening mammograms on rates of breast cancer detection. Design, Setting, and Participants A multicenter, double-blind, cluster randomized clinical trial conducted at 46 specialized breast screening centers from the National Health Service Breast Screening Program in England for 1 year (all between December 20, 2012, and November 3, 2014). Three hundred sixty readers participated (mean, 7.8 readers per center)—186 radiologists, 143 radiography advanced practitioners, and 31 breast clinicians, all fully qualified to report mammograms in the NHS breast screening program. Interventions The 2 readers examined each batch of digital mammograms in the same order in the control group and in the opposite order to one another in the intervention group. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was cancer detection rate; secondary outcomes were rates of recall and disagreements between readers. Results Among 1\\u202f194\\u202f147 women (mean age, 59.3; SD, 7.49) who had screening mammograms (596\\u202f642 in the intervention group; 597\\u202f505 in the control group), the images were interpreted in 37\\u202f688 batches (median batch size, 35; interquartile range [IQR]; 16-46), with each reader interpreting a median of 176 batches (IQR, 96-278). After completion of all subsequent diagnostic tests, a total of 10\\u202f484 cases (0.88%) of breast cancer were detected. There was no significant difference in cancer detection rate with 5272 cancers (0.88%) detected in the intervention group vs 5212 cancers (0.87%) detected in the control group (difference, 0.01% points; 95% CI, −0.02% to 0.04% points; recall rate, 24\\u202f681 [4.14%] vs 24\\u202f894 [4.17%]; difference, −0.03% points; 95% CI, −0.10% to 0.04% points; or rate of reader disagreements, 20\\u202f471 [3.43%] vs 20\\u202f793 [3.48%]; difference, −0.05% points; 95% CI, −0.11% to 0.02% points).

Physical activity can increase life expectancy, reduce hospital admission, and improve quality of life for people with COPD. Previous research has focussed on the use of activity monitors for monitoring physical activity, often as an objective research measure. However, understanding the experiences of people with COPD using monitoring technology in everyday life could support the development and delivery of effective interventions to increase activity levels. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of people with COPD using activity monitors at home in everyday life.\\n\\nMethods Seven semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted with people with COPD between August 2018 and June 2020. Eligible participants had all used apps and/or wearables (i.e., Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple Watch) to monitor their activity (e.g., steps, distance, heart rate) within the last year. Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).\\n\\nResults Four themes were developed using IPA demonstrating the positive and negative journey of engagement with activity monitors over time: 1) Motivational features to keep monitoring physical activity, 2) The importance of setting achievable goals to manage expectations of activity, 3) Development of knowledge and awareness of activity levels, and 4) Life with the tracker from ‘before’ to ‘now’.\\n\\nConclusions This study has provided a detailed insight into how people with COPD use apps and wearables to monitor their physical activity at home in everyday life. Monitoring technology has the potential to widely benefit people with COPD by increasing physical activity and self-management of their health condition. However, further research is needed to understand how healthcare practitioners can support and encourage people with COPD to engage with technology. Understanding how to incorporate technology and utilise activity data collected at home could enable more effective remote delivery of interventions, healthcare, and treatment.',\n",

In South Africa, smallholder agriculture faces multiple\\nchallenges due to historical injustices regarding access to land and resources and to post-apartheid policies that failed to promote rural development. Drawing on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework and employing a mixed methods approach, we explore through participant observation and interviews the prospects of smallholder agricultural programs for establishing sustainable livelihoods, facilitated by civil society organizations and targeted at rural black and colored South African women. Participation in these programs enabled women access to various livelihoods assets: education and capacity-building (human assets); land (natural assets); tools and\\ninfrastructure (physical assets); stipends and income from selling their produce (financial assets); and networking (social assets). Operational challenges included divergent expectations on the side of project facilitators and participants; lack of\\ncommunication; participant dependency on the organizations; lack of access to markets; and programs’ lack of financial sustainability. Our findings suggest that, while these programs are not yet sustainable, they stimulate an awareness of\\npossibilities, visions, ownership, and rights that can have a long-term effect on the livelihoods of these women. In evaluating program success, especially in the initiation phases, it must be remembered that structural barriers to the improvement of rural\\nwomen’s livelihoods are formidable, and few South African models or alternatives are presently available to help civil society organizations formulate new opportunities.',\n",

The effect of interlayer hammer peening and interlayer temperature was investigated for the single bead walls. We also examined the residual stress in compact‐tension (C(T)) coupons extracted from large builds (walls) with crack orientation either parallel with or perpendicular to the build direction. This type of sample is often used for the measurement of the fatigue crack growth rate. The contour method was used for experimental determinations of residual stress. In addtion, residual stress in the C(T) coupons was estimated by finite element (FE) analysis. A good agreement was achieved between the contour method and FE analysis. The oscillation‐path wall had the lowest residual stress values. For the single bead walls built with various process conditions, residual stress was significantly reduced after removing the substrate. A interlayer temperature of 110 °C resulted in much higher residual stress values in the wall (both tensile and compressive) compared to the continuous build. with much higher interlayer temperature.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: In the last number of years heightened interest has been attributed to the impact of hospital environments on children's psychosocial well-being. With policy largely built around adult assumptions, knowledge about what constitutes a child-friendly hospital environment from young children's perspectives has been lacking. If hospital environments are to aspire to being child friendly then the views of younger aged children must be taken into account. The current study investigated young children's perspectives of hospital social spaces to inform the design of the built environment of a new children's hospital. Methods: An exploratory qualitative participatory design was employed. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews (one-to-one and group workshops) which incorporated art-based activities to actively engage young children. Fifty-five young children aged 5 to 8 years with various acute and chronic illnesses were recruited from inpatient, outpatient and emergency departments of three children's hospitals. Results: Young children want a diversity of readily available, independently accessible, age, gender and developmentally appropriate leisure and entertainment facilities seamlessly integrated throughout the hospital environment. Such activities were invaluable for creating a positive hospital experience for children by combating boredom, enriching choice and control and reducing a sense of isolation through enhanced socialization. When in hospital, young children want to feel socially connected to the internal hospital community as well as to the outside world. Technology can assist to broaden the spectrum of children's social connectivity when in hospital – to home, school and the wider outside world. Conclusion: While technology offers many opportunities to support children's psychosocial well-being when in confined healthcare spaces, the implementation and operation of such services and systems require much further research in the areas of ethics, facilitation, organizational impact and evaluation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background Technological advances offer opportunities to redesign existing chlamydia screening and testing, and treatment pathways, to improve screening uptake and the proportion of positive individuals successfully treated. Innovations underway include self-tests networked through mobile phones, which could be combined with online clinical care and other non-face-to-face care pathways. Evidence of young people's preferences should be key to informing optimum service redesign. We aimed to quantify factors affecting young people's preferences for emerging chlamydia testing and treatment pathway options in a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Methods Methods used to select attributes and levels for the DCE included a systematic literature review, four focus groups (staged recruitment to include spread in age range 16–24 years and other demographic characteristics), and four expert groups of clinicians and researchers. The literature review sought stated preference studies for testing and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI) published before Dec 31, 2015. Studies were published in English, and included one or more aspects of mainstream STI testing and treatment for any STI, undertaken in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development high-income country. Key search terms included stated preference, stated choice, DCE, contingent valuation, and conjoint analysis. A draft questionnaire was tested in a pilot (n=9). The final questionnaire (including 25 pairwise choices with opt-out) was completed online by a national panel of young people aged 16–24 years across England (YouthSight). Analysis used multinomial logit models and included validity checks. Findings There were 1230 respondents (response rate 73%). The strongest attribute affecting preferences was chlamydia test accuracy (odds ratio [OR] 3·24, 95% CI 3·13–3·36), followed by time to result (1·81, 1·71–1·91). Respondents showed a preference for remote chlamydia testing options (self-testing, self-sampling, postal testing) over attendance at a testing location. A general preference for accessing treatment was observed for online (OR 1·21, 95% CI 1·15–1·28) versus traditional general practice (1·18, 1·12–1·24), pharmacy (1·15, 1·10–1·22), or clinic (OR 1) services. Little difference was observed between face-to-face, telephone, instant messaging or email methods of access. No significant difference in preferences was seen for antibiotic provision (eg, collection from pharmacy vs postal delivery). Interpretation DCE coefficients can help estimate uptake probabilities for redesigned chlamydia pathways. Although this DCE was conducted in an online population, which might limit generalisabiity to other populations, findings could assist technology developers, policy makers, commissioners, and service providers to optimise the adoption of emerging technologies and service redesign.\",\n",

All metformin-induced effects were attenuated NBTI was co-administered. The MTT assay demonstrated an increase in the EC50-value during co-administration of metformin with sunitinib compared to sunitinib mono-therapy in HepG2 and HL-60 cell lines, demonstrating the impact and complexity of metformin co-administration and the possible role of AMPK signalling.

This strategy creates the need for advanced multi-material joining technologies. The compatibility of the adhesive with a wide range of material types and the possibility of joining multi-material structures is also a key advantage to its success. In this paper, the feasibility of using either epoxy or polyurethane adhesive joining techniques applied to the multi-material vehicle structure is investigated. Importantly, consideration is given to the effect of variation in bond thickness for both families of structural adhesives. Multi-material adhesively bonded single lap joints with different adhesives of controlled bond thicknesses were manufactured and tested in order to experimentally assess the shear strength and stiffness. The torsional stiffness and natural frequency of the vehicle were modelled using a global two-dimensional finite element model (FEM) with different adhesive properties, and the obtained vehicle performances were further explained by the coupon-level experimental tests. The results showed that the vehicle using polyurethane adhesive with a target bond thickness of 1.0 mm allowed for optimal modal frequency and weight reduction.',\n",

The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the therapist-perceived supports and barriers to using occupational therapy home programmes for children with unilateral cerebral palsy, based on evidence of best practice in the United Kingdom. Method: Fourteen occupational therapists completed semi-structured telephone interviews. Using a qualitative framework analysis approach, support and barrier factors were indexed against the Theoretical Domains Framework, before being categorised more broadly using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour Model. Findings: Common supports included: (a) strong leadership within the team to facilitate the translation of occupational therapy home programmes and evidence-based interventions into service-specific protocols; (b) knowledge exchange within professional networks and (c) mentorship. Common barriers included: (a) lack of resources; (b) restricted opportunities to review occupational therapy home programmes and (c) difficulties keeping up-to-date with the evidence in this area. Conclusion: To be effective, occupational therapy home programmes need to be based on evidence of best practice; analysis indicated an urgent need to capture outcomes, record parental practice, further integrate ‘occupation’ within goal-setting, and develop use of conceptual models of practice to both enhance family-centred care and articulate the profession’s unique contribution.',\n",

It aims to develop a bonded polymer modified overlay with the superior mechanical properties of concrete and the special workability of asphalt to facilitate fast construction by asphalt paving machinery. The utilization of the residual structural potential of the existing worn pavement makes it more sustainable in both environmental and economic terms as an alternative to the wholesale reconstruction of the existing structural concrete pavement.\\nThe special concrete mix was optimized by a newly developed method highlighted in this article to provide sound mechanical properties and practical construction solutions for fast repairing techniques. The problems associated with achieving structurally effective bonded concrete overlays, such as reflective cracking due to flexure failure, shear failure and delamination were examined in detail by a considerable number of rigorously conducted laboratory experiments.\\nThis paper launches the new mix design method, the geometrical size effect and the efficiency of steel fibre on the structural behaviour of the roller compacted, polymer modified concrete. The new mix design highlighted in the article is the key to achieving good mechanical performance with rapid construction technologies. The investigation of flexural resistance disclosed the size effect on flexural strength in the PMC (Polymer Modified Concrete) beams.\\nA comparison was made between the roller-compacted PMC and the conventional PMC regarding the behaviour of steel fibre in crack control.\\nA series of tests were carried out on PMC beams with 1%, 1.5% and 2% of steel fibres to evaluate its impact on the shear, splitting tensile, flexural and compressive strength levels. The same PMC was experimentally tested at early ages and proved to have very high strength at an early stage. This can minimise the duration of traffic control and be beneficial for both highways authorities and road users. The investigation on the material and the structural performance will hopefully permit pavement engineers to further exploit its advantages such as economy, convenience and long, maintenance free life that PRSS could offer.',\n",

Concerns for metallic parts built via SLM are the process-induced residual stresses, and anisotropic mechanical properties. This paper investigates the effect of residual stresses on the fatigue crack growth rate of SLM Ti6Al4V in as-built and stress-relieved conditions. Neutron diffraction and the contour method are employed to measure residual stresses in compact-tension samples. Neutron diffraction results are in good agreement with the contour method. It was found that tensile stresses are present at the notch root and the free edge areas, and compressive stress is seen in the middle of the sample. The tensile stresses in the as-built condition resulted in a higher fatigue crack growth rate. After stress relieving by heat treatment, the tensile residual stress diminished by around 90%, resulting in decreased crack growth rate. The build direction was seen to affect the crack growth rate, although the trend was different between the as-built and stress-relieved conditions.',\n",

Besides, cancer patients and survivors are severely immunocompromised due to the harsh effect of anti-cancer therapy targeting the bone marrow cells. Cancer patients and survivors can therefore be potentially extremely clinically vulnerable and at risk from infectious diseases. The recent global outbreak of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its infection called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a worldwide health emergency, and on the 11th of March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).\\nA high fatality rate has been reported in COVID-19 patients suffering from underlying cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the critical and crucial aspect of monitoring cancer patients and survivors for potential cardiovascular complications during this unprecedented health crisis involving the progressive worldwide spread of COVID-19.\\nCOVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, however, COVID-19 has shown cardiac injury symptoms similar to the cardiotoxicity associated with anti-cancer therapy, including arrhythmia, myocardial injury and infarction, and heart failure. Due to the significant prevalence of micro- and macro-emboli and damaged vessels clinicians worldwide have begun to consider whether COVID-19 may in fact be as much a vascular disease as a respiratory disease.\\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms and pathways facilitating the COVID-19 -induced cardiac injury in cancer and non-cancer patients remains unclear. Investigations into whether COVID-19 cardiac injury and anti-cancer drug-induced cardiac injury in cancer patients and survivors might synergistically increase the cardiovascular complications and comorbidity risk through a “two-hit” model are needed. Identification of cardiac injury mechanisms and pathways associated with COVID-19 development overlapping with anti-cancer therapy could help clinicians to allow a more optimised prognosis and treatment of cancer survivors suffering from COVID-19.\\nThe following review will focus on summarising the harmful cardiovascular risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients and survivors treated with an anti-cancer drug. This review will improve the knowledge of COVID-19 impact in the field of cardio-oncology and potentially improve the outcome of patients.',\n",

Methods: Eleven young people aged 11–16 years with a prior diagnosis of DCD were identified from child health records of two participating NHS trusts. The sample included seven boys and four girls, from different socio-economic backgrounds living in different parts of one large urban area in England. In depth one-to-one semi-structured interviews and subsequent follow-up small group interviews were carried out with the young people. Interviews were enhanced using participatory arts-based techniques. All interviews were recorded verbatim and transcribed. Narrative data were analysed using Lindseth's interpretive phenomenology. Results: The central theme of ‘We're all different’ described how the young person saw themselves and encompassed the formation of identity. Subthemes illustrated the attitude of the young people to their day to day lives, their difficulties and strategies used by the young people to overcome these difficulties in school and at home. The attitude of the school to difference, the presence of bullying, the accepting nature of the class, teachers and peers were vitally important. Areas of life that encouraged a positive sense of identity and worth included being part of a social network that gave the young people a sense of belonging, potentially one that valued differences as well as similarities. Conclusion: The current work highlights the need for services to adopt a model of DCD where the young person talks about what they can do and considers strategies of overcoming their difficulties. This has implications for education and future intervention strategies that focus on fostering psychological resilience and educational coping strategies rather than simply attempting to improve motor skills.\",\n",

So far systematic review evidence summarises quantitative studies investigating the acceptability, efficacy and effectiveness of apps and wearables related to physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Qualitative research can provide an in-depth insight into the barriers and facilitators of using apps and wearables. This systematic review aims to synthesise the qualitative literature on the barriers and facilitators of using apps and wearables to automatically monitor PA and SB in adults. Methods: This review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017070194). Scientific databases including CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published from 1st January 2012 to 1st September 2017. Studies were included if they 1) included adults who used an app or wearable to automatically monitor PA and/or SB 2) explored the barriers and/or facilitators of using such technology and 3) were published in English. Following double screening of 4,550 titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially eligible papers were screened to identify studies using qualitative approaches to explore barriers and facilitators of using apps and/or wearables to automatically monitor PA and/or SB. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third screener. Relevant excerpts (quotes and text) from the included papers will be extracted and analysed with thematic synthesis. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist will be used to appraise included studies. Findings: Initial findings highlight barriers to using apps and wearables to monitor PA and SB are around the accuracy of the devices in detecting activity and the comfort and aesthetics of the device. Facilitators for using the devices include increasing individuals' motivation to be more physically active and self-awareness of PA levels. Results are to be confirmed as full text screening and data analysis is expected to be completed by July 2018. Conclusion: This presentation will discuss the preliminary findings of the thematic synthesis. The results of this work will be useful for those intending to monitor PA and/or SB using these technologies.\",\n",

Method: A national online survey questionnaire was conducted with occupational therapists to explore their current occupational therapy home programme practices, and attitudes toward using home programmes with children with cerebral palsy. Recruitment was through members of two sections of the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, a University’s Fieldwork-Supervisor’s Database and self-selection following promotion on occupational therapy networks, social media and newsletters. Results: Of all survey respondents (n = 123), the majority of respondents (n = 74; 60%) used occupational therapy home programmes. The uptake and use of evidence-based home programme content varied, revealing evidence-practice gaps. Respondents clearly articulated their professional reasoning and acknowledged benefits of using home programmes. However, they reported barriers to implementing them within a family-centred framework, citing time constraints, lack of knowledge, skills and training, and insufficient support. Conclusion: Occupational therapists report challenges to implementing evidence-based interventions and the routine, systematic application of a range of standardised measurement tools pre/post occupational therapy home programmes. Such tools would enhance quality outcomes for children with cerebral palsy and their families. However, occupational therapists indicated the need for greater organisational support, further education and skill development in these areas.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chemical inhibitors are often implemented for the functional characterization of genes to overcome the limitations associated with genetic approaches. Although it is well established that the specificity of the compound is key to success of a pharmacological approach, off-target effects are often overlooked or simply neglected in a complex biological setting. Here we illustrate the cause and implications of such secondary effects by focusing on piperonylic acid (PA), an inhibitor of CINNAMATE-4-HYDROXYLASE (C4H) that is frequently used to investigate the involvement of lignin during plant growth and development. When supplied to plants, we found that PA is recognized as a substrate by GRETCHEN HAGEN 3.6 (GH3.6), an amido synthetase involved in the formation of the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) conjugate IAA-Asp. By competing for the same enzyme, PA interferes with IAA conjugation, resulting in an increase in IAA concentrations in the plant. In line with the broad substrate specificity of the GH3 family of enzymes, treatment with PA increased not only IAA levels but also those of other GH3-conjugated phytohormones, namely jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Finally, we found that interference with the endogenous function of GH3s potentially contributes to phenotypes previously observed upon PA treatment. We conclude that deregulation of phytohormone homeostasis by surrogate occupation of the conjugation machinery in the plant is likely a general phenomenon when using chemical inhibitors. Our results hereby provide a novel and important basis for future reference in studies using chemical inhibitors.',\n",

Current cell performance monitoring, which relies on measurements of full cell voltage and sporadic surface temperature, does not provide a reliable information on the true internal battery state. Here, we address this issue by transforming off the shelf cells into smart systems by embedding flexible distributed sensors for long-term in-situ and operando thermodynamic data collection. Our approach, which enables the monitoring of the true battery state, does not impact its performance. In particular, our results show that this unprecedented methodology can be used to optimise the performance and map the safety limits of lithium-ion cells. We find that the cell core temperature is consistently and significantly higher than the surface temperature, and reveal a breach of safety limits during a rapid discharge test. We also demonstrate an application of a current considerably higher than the manufacturers’ specification, enabling a significant decrease in charging time, without compromising the cell's thermal stability. Consequently, this work on cell instrumentation methodology has the potential to facilitate significant advances in battery technology.\",\n",

Databases were searched from their inception to 4 February 2013. Databases included MEDLINE, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, The Cochrane Library, Social Science Citation Index, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, The Campbell Collaboration and ProQuest for dissertations.\\nReview methods Studies were included if they reported evaluation data about interventions designed to improve therapeutic outcomes by improving communication between BME patients and psychiatric professionals. Qualitative studies and reports in the grey literature were included only if they gave a critical evaluative statement. Two members of the team selected studies against pre-established criteria and any differences were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer, if necessary. Data were extracted independently by two people and summarised in tables by specific study designs. Studies were subjected to a narrative synthesis that included a thematic analysis contrasting populations, countries and the strength of evidence for any intervention. The components of the interventions were compared. Patient perspectives on acceptability were considered alongside quality scores and methodological strengths and weaknesses.\\nResults Twenty-one studies (19 from the published literature and two from the grey literature) met the inclusion criteria. There were 12 trials, two observational quantitative studies, three case series, a qualitative study and three descriptive case studies. Only two studies, one a pilot trial and one a case series, included economic data; in both, a favourable but weak economic case could be made for the intervention. The trials tested interventions to prepare patients for therapeutic interventions, variable levels of ethnic matching (of professional to patient), cultural adaptation of therapies, and interventions that included social community systems in order to facilitate access to services. Empowering interventions favoured by patients and carers included adapted cognitive–behavioural therapy, assessments of explanatory models, cultural consultation, ethnographic and motivational interviews, and a telepsychiatry intervention.\\nLimitations Studies tended to have small sample sizes or to be pilot studies, and to use proxy rather than direct measures for TCs.\\nConclusions Empowering interventions should be further researched and brought to the attention of commissioners. Several promising interventions need further evaluative research and economic evaluations are needed.Study registrationThe study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42011001661.FundingThe National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme\",\n",

A bonded polymer modified and fibre reinforced overlay with the superior mechanical properties of concrete to sustain high strength and the special workability of asphalt to facilitate fast construction by asphalt paving machinery has been developed. The utilization of the residual structural potential of the existing worn pavement makes it more sustainable in both environmental and economic terms as an alternative to the wholesale reconstruction of the existing structural concrete pavement. A unique concrete mix was designed and optimized by a new, specially developed method described elsewhere, offering superior mechanical properties and practical construction solutions for fast repairing techniques. The problems associated with achieving structurally effective bonded concrete overlays, such as reflective cracking due to flexural failure, shear failure and delamination were examined in detail by a large number of rigorously conducted laboratory experiments and an appropriate number of numerical models. Essentially, a series of tests were carried out on Polymer Modified Concrete beams with 1%, 1.5% and 2% by volume of steel fibres to evaluate its impact on the shear, tensile-splitting, flexural and compressive strength levels. The same PMC was experimentally tested at early ages and proved to have very high strength at an early stage. This can minimise the duration of traffic control and be beneficial for both highways authorities and road users. A corresponding number of numerical models were developed at the same time depicting successfully the laboratory tests and results. These models were used for the appropriate parametric and sensitivity studies and provided the necessary confidence and experience regarding the various modes and mechanisms of failure. Essentially, the finite element models depicted successfully cracks developing due to predominant shear and/or flexural stresses, their propagation through the ‘old’ concrete pavement and finally their ‘reflection’ through the new overlay. They also depicted the delamination process, clearly showing the separation of the two materials. The development of the material and the improvement of its structural performance will hopefully permit pavement engineers to further exploit its advantages such as economy, convenience and long, maintenance free life that PRS could offer.',\n",

One possibility is to precondition the input polynomials using Groebner Basis (GB) theory. Previous experiments have shown that while this can often be very beneficial to the CAD algorithm, for some problems it can significantly worsen the CAD performance. In the present paper we investigate whether machine learning, specifically a support vector machine (SVM), may be used to identify those CAD problems which benefit from GB preconditioning. We run experiments with over 1000 problems (many times larger than previous studies) and find that the machine learned choice does better than the human-made heuristic.',\n",

This study aimed to explore barriers and facilitators to engaging in these behaviours following cancer treatment. Methods During the development of a web-based intervention to enhance health-related quality of life in cancer survivors, 32 people who had completed treatment for breast, colon or prostate cancer were presented with an intervention for PA and healthy eating. In-depth think-aloud and semi-structured interviewing techniques were used to elicit perceptions of both behaviours. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Some individuals reported implementing positive health behaviour changes to maintain health and prevent recurrence, or to help them to move forward after cancer. However, others reported feeling abandoned, and many did not report an intention to engage in lifestyle changes. Individuals discussed contextual and healthrelated barriers that were specifically linked to their situation as post-treatment cancer survivors: individuals described uncertainty about how to implement adaptive changes and perceived a lack of support from healthcare providers. Others viewed behaviour change as unnecessary or undesirable, with some arguing that nonmodifiable factors contributed more to their cancer diagnosis than lifestyle-related factors. Conclusions For many participants in this study, the period that follows treatment for cancer did not represent a ‘teachable moment’. A variety of complex and heterogeneous factors appeared to impact motivation, and may limit cancer survivors from engaging with diet and PA changes.',\n",

A numerical simulation based on the inherent strain method was used to model residual stresses arising from the manufacturing process. The contour method was used to experimentally determine the residual stress field. High tensile residual stresses were seen at and around the interface of the substrate and the deposited metal. Compressive residual stresses were present in the substrate and at the top of the deposit. The satisfactory correlation was achieved between the results from the numerical simulation and the contour method, except for the location of the root of the deposit. The effect of pre-heating the sample substrate on the residual stress distribution is also discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'All beauty, richness and harmony in the emergent dynamics of a complex system largely depend on the specific way in which its elementary components interact. The last twenty-five years have seen the birth and development of the multidisciplinary field of Network Science, wherein a variety of distributed systems in physics, biology, social sciences and engineering have been modeled as networks of coupled units, in the attempt to unveil the mechanisms underneath their observed functionality. There is, however, a fundamental limit to such a representation: networks capture only pairwise interactions, whereas the functioning of many real-world systems not only involves dyadic connections, but rather is the outcome of collective actions at the level of groups of nodes. For instance, in ecological systems, three or more species may compete for food or territory, and similar multi-component interactions appear in functional and structural brain networks, protein interaction networks, semantic networks, multi-authors scientific collaborations, offline and online social networks, gene regulatory networks and spreading of consensus or contagious diseases due to multiple, simultaneous, contacts. Such multi-component interactions can only be grasped through either hypergraphs or simplicial complexes, which indeed have recently found a huge number of applications. In this report, we cover the extensive literature of the past years on this subject, and we focus on the structure and dynamics of hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. These are indeed becoming increasingly relevant, thanks to the enhanced resolution of data sets and the recent advances in data analysis techniques, which (concurrently and definitely) have shown that such structures play a pivotal role in the complex organization and functioning of real-world distributed systems.',\n",

The internet has many positive benefits for young people such as access to educational resources, health advice, and leisure interests available online. However, issues including cyberbullying, sexting, viewing of inappropriate content, grooming and hacking have all raised concerns about online safety of young people. This project aimed to understand the current online activities and experiences of young people of secondary school age 11-16 in relation to online risks and resilience, as well as their understanding of online safety practices.\\nMethod: Twenty-six students (males =14, female=16) from years 7 to 11 (ages 11-16) participated in four focus groups. NVivo 10 qualitative data analysis computer software was used to assist the organisation and analysis of the data into themes.\\nResults: This is explored using a qualitative method of enquiry. Five codebooks were identified from the analysis of the data. They combine a wide range of issues and include E-safety education, Risk taking behaviour, Generation Gap, Help-seeking, Online experiences.\\nConclusion: Young people are keen to know how to stay safe online and who is appropriate to contact if they have concerns, and voice a general need for more consistent education and support appropriate to their needs. Implications for future practice in education settings are discussed regarding the findings that in the UK this issue has gained priority on the policy agenda.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Purpose\\n– The world's leading manufacturers of fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs) generate up to 50 per cent of their revenues in emerging markets. Simulated test marketing (STM) is a common practice deployed by these companies to forecast new product sales. Emerging markets represent only a small portion of the global STM business. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate and further explore some key trends anticipated in the development of the future generation of STM models by drawing specific attention to the issues currently experienced in one of the emerging markets, Russia.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach\\n– A quantitative survey of Russian client-side marketing experts provides strong evidence for the need to further improve and modify STM methods, addressing new challenges in rapidly developing markets of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and Africa.\\n\\nFindings\\n– Marketers in Russia believe many STM approaches poorly reflect the nuances and characteristics of their markets. This has implications for global players targeting emerging markets based on assumptions formed for STM in their home markets.\\n\\nResearch limitations/implications\\n– This is a preliminary study which warrants following up. Its basis in Russia arguably has implications for other emerging markets, but whether these findings are evident in other markets needs to be tested.\\n\\nPractical implications\\n– FMCG companies in Russia would appreciate a flexible, proactive, “client-oriented” approach as opposed to conservative, “model-centered” services based on “global” execution standards. This would lead to the co-creation of STM models that could achieve more accurate forecasts in emerging markets and achieve a greater level of confidence in the use of STM among multinational FMCG companies.\\n\\nOriginality/value\\n– The research undertaken leads to a general conclusion that although traditional STM models have attained relatively high awareness among FMCGs in Russia, their use is still limited as there is a perception of this being a research instrument that would need adaptation to the Russian market. Instead, simpler, cheaper and less time consuming alternatives are often employed, such as expert assessments, basic quantitative or qualitative tests. Although the most commonly acknowledged advantages of STM are well understood in Russia, there are some key barriers to its widespread adoption: poor quality or insufficient market data, lack of local market experience and validations, lower forecast accuracy as compared to “western” markets, low flexibility in terms of design and cost.\",\n",

The proposed method is simple and requires limited equipment. Furthermore, electrical performance is significantly better and the cell capacity and resistance can be recorded for longer durations when compared to some of the previously used methods. Electrical performance of this new third electrode method is characterized and compared to 18650 cells with no reference electrode inserted. The capacity retention of the modified cell is more than 98% in the first 20 cycles. Harvested electrodes from a disassembled cell were also used to make coin cells that was proven to be a rather critical approach to get electrode potentials and capacities. This is an initial study that shows three-electrode performances of a commercial 18650-type cell, which suggests it could be used for understanding electrode behavior throughout a cell lifetime and for manufacturing instrumented cells.',\n",

Aims: To review the evidence on interventions designed to improve therapeutic communications between Black and minority ethnic patients and clinicians who provide care in psychiatric services. Method: Systematic review and evidence synthesis (PROSPERO registration: CRD42011001661). Data sources included the published and the 'grey' literature. A survey of experts and a consultation with patients and carers all contributed to the evidence synthesis, interpretation and recommendations. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in our analysis. The trials showed benefits mainly for depressive symptoms, experiences of care, knowledge, stigma, adherence to prescribed medication, insight and alliance. The effect sizes were smaller for better-quality trials (range of d 0.18-0.75) than for moderate- or lower-quality studies (range of d 0.18-4.3). The review found only two studies offering weak economic evidence. Conclusions: Culturally adapted psychotherapies, and ethnographic and motivational assessment leading to psychotherapies were effective and favoured by patients and carers. Further trials are needed from outside of the UK and USA, as are economic evaluations and studies of routine psychiatric care practices\",\n",

Nevertheless, the Bezout bound tells us that number of zeros of a zero-dimensional system is singly-exponential in the number of variables. How should this contradiction be reconciled? We first note that Mayr and Ritscher in 2013 showed the doubly exponential nature of Gröbner bases is with respect to the dimension of the ideal, not the number of variables. This inspires us to consider what can be done for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition which produces a doubly-exponential number of polynomials of doubly-exponential degree. We review work from ISSAC 2015 which showed the number of polynomials could be restricted to doubly-exponential in the (complex) dimension using McCallum’s theory of reduced projection in the presence of equational constraints. We then discuss preliminary results showing the same for the degree of those polynomials. The results are under primitivity assumptions whose importance we illustrate.',\n",

Background: neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic condition, which is highly variable and unpredictable. It can result in varying degrees of visible difference (disfigurement). Both the effect of NF1 on appearance and its uncertainty can prove particularly difficult for those affected. However, very little research to date has investigated the psychosocial impact of neurofibromatosis type 1 on young people or their experiences of managing it. Design: Exploratory qualitative interview study. Methods: Nine young people aged 14-24, with a confirmed diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1, took part in semi-structured interviews between March-September 2011. Interview transcripts were thematically analysed. Findings: Three key themes were identified from the data: (1) 'Different things to different people' reflecting the variability in the condition; (2) 'Relationships and reactions' relating to individuals' social experience; and (3) 'Understanding and misunderstanding' reflecting participants' experiences with organizations and social structures. Conclusions: Findings suggest a need for further research to explore young people's adaptation and management of neurofibromatosis type 1. In particular, raising awareness and understanding of the condition among professionals and in the general public was an important issue for young people. In addition, access to trustworthy information about neurofibromatosis type 1 and practical advice to support adjustment to an altered appearance and managing stigma experiences are highlighted as areas to be considered further\",\n",

The aim of this critical review was to gain a deeper understanding of how bimanual therapy and modified constraint induced movement therapy or constraint induced movement therapy methods are used within occupational therapy home programmes from an occupational perspective.\\n\\nMethod\\nA literature search was conducted using electronic databases for health research; five studies met the inclusion criteria. These were critically appraised and were analysed according to the relevant supports and barriers of the person–environment–occupation conceptual model of practice.\\n\\nFindings\\nFamily collaboration, strategic use of outcome measures, construction of the programme within the home environment and occupation-focused goals and activities emerged as commonly used methods. Enhanced descriptions of intervention context, the child’s voice in defining goals and challenges in optimising occupational balance surfaced as gaps in the programmes.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe methods used in implementing these approaches within occupational therapy home programmes requires combining motor and non-motor approaches, core occupational therapy skills, working within individual contexts and valuing family preferences. Using child-specific goal-setting instruments would strengthen the child’s voice and promote participation within a wider range of occupations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There has been extensive research in the development of Gasoline Direct Injection ‘GDI’ engine exhaust systems with the aim of reducing engine-out emissions and meeting legislation requirements. Depending on the room available for packaging the exhaust system, the engine may be equipped with a single catalyst or two catalysts one close to the engine and another one located further downstream. With the strict particulate matter emission regulations of GDI engine, the engine has to be equipped with a Gasoline Particulate Filter ‘GPF’ in addition to the Closed Coupled Catalyst ‘CCC’. The common practice is to have the GPF further downstream the catalyst. In this paper, an assessment method is carried for a new design of a hot end exhaust system. The new design brings the GPF closer to ‘CCC’ to be packed in the same enclosure. The gas flow velocity and pressure distributions inside the exhaust system are identified using CFD for a uniform exhaust gas flow inlet conditions. The system also has been investigated considering a typical inlet exhaust gas flow conditions from a GDI engine turbocharger. Results showed that the new design offers better flow uniformity in both the catalyst and GPF. Moreover, lower pressure drop across the whole system is observed relative to the baseline design with the GPF separated from the catalyst through an intermediate exhaust pipe. The GPF enclosure end shape is found to have influence on the flow uniformity and pressure drop.',\n",

The fretting fatigue life is restricted in high cycle fatigue regime when the contact load is higher than the critical one.

This chapter traces developments in the use of corpora as a means of feedback delivery in EAP contexts, from the early days of stand-alone computers to current applications embedded within university-wide virtual learning environments. EAP feedback can be used to correct mechanical errors, suggest stylistic changes, encourage reflection on communicative intent, and develop independent learning practices which can be continued for the remainder of the learner's working life. The chapter reviews the research into corpus-informed feedback for all these purposes, and considers ways in which the use of corpora for feedback might be extended, taking into consideration recent technological advances both in corpus query software and computer interconnectivity. It also reports on the creation and use of corpora of university-level written feedback and on the way such corpora can shed light on the distribution and wording of common feedback functions such as, advice, critique, observation, praise, and query. The chapter ends with some suggestions for further research into the effectiveness of corpus-informed feedback, both in the short term, for immediate application, and in the long-term, as a step towards greater learner autonomy.\",\n",

Background: The Health Care Professional Council Standards of Education and Training requires clinical psychology training programmes to demonstrate evidence of the involvement of service users and carers. The British Psychological Society good practice guidelines for the involvement of service users and carers in clinical psychology training programmes were published by the BPS in 2008. Thus, the involvement of EbE is recommended for all aspects of training of clinical psychologists, however the impact of their involvement outside teaching activities has rarely been evaluated. Methods: A qualitative design was employed given the project's explorative nature. Semi-structured, individual interviews were carried out with six participants recruited through purposive sampling of second year clinical psychology trainees and EbE who participated in the Buddy Groups pilot funded by Education Commissioning for Quality, Health Education. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was utilised for data analysis of the interviews and participants’ reflective notes from the Buddy Group sessions. Findings & Conclusions: Four superordinate themes emerged from the analysis representing the participants’ experiences: ‘Purpose’, ‘Increased understanding and empathy for’, ‘Experience’ and ‘Lived realities’. Findings suggest that the Buddy Group initiative has been well received and enhanced knowledge and understanding; particularly with respect to professional and service issues, provided a forum for Experts by Experience and trainees’ perspectives and equalised power relations.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib is used to treat cancer and is linked to severe adverse cardiovascular events. Mitogen activated kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is involved in the development of cardiac injury and is a component of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is the upstream activator of MKK7 and is specifically inhibited by 2,7-dihydro-2,7-dioxo-3H-naphtho[1,2,3-de]quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (NQDI-1). This study investigates the role of ASK1, MKK7 and JNK during Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity.\\n\\nInfarct size were measured in isolated male Sprague-Dawley rat Langendorff perfused hearts treated for 125 min with Sunitinib in the presence and absence of NQDI-1. Left ventricular cardiac tissue samples were analysed by qRT-PCR for MKK7 mRNA expression and cardiotoxicity associated microRNAs (miR-1, miR-27a, miR-133a and miR-133b) or Western blot analysis to measure ASK1/MKK7/JNK phosphorylation.\\n\\nAdministration of Sunitinib (1 µM) during Langendorff perfusion resulted in increased infarct size, increased miR-133a expression, and decreased phosphorylation of the ASK1/MKK7/JNK pathway compared to control. Co-administration of NQDI-1 (2.5 µM) attenuated the increased Sunitinib-induced infarct size, reversed miR-133a expression and restored phosphorylated levels of ASK1/MKK7/JNK. These findings suggest that the ASK1/MKK7/JNK intracellular signalling pathway is important in Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. The anti-cancer properties of Sunitinib were also assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. Sunitinib significantly decreased the cell viability of human acute myeloid leukemia 60 cell line (HL60). The combination of Sunitinib (1 nM - 10 µM) with NQDI-1 (2.5 µM) enhanced the cancer-fighting properties of Sunitinib. Investigations into the ASK1/MKK7/JNK transduction pathway could lead to development of cardioprotective adjunct therapy, which could prevent Sunitinib-induced cardiac injury.',\n",

Within the eSTI2 consortium (www.esti2.org.uk) we developed UK’s first automated Online Clinical Care Pathway for people with genital chlamydia (Chlamydia-OCCP) within an eSexual Health Clinic (eSHC). Chlamydia-OCCP includes: STI results service; clinical consultation; electronic prescription via community pharmacy; partner notification (PN); with integral telephone helpline support. It complies with regulatory, professional, prescribing and surveillance requirements. We report on a study to assess Chlamydia-OCCP feasibility and acceptability as an alternative to routine care. Methods Non-randomised, exploratory study to evaluate Chlamydia-OCCP: 21.07.14 -13.03.15.Participants: 1) chlamydia-positive untreated Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) clinic attenders; 2) people testing chlamydia-positive and negative through six National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) areas’ online postal self-sampling service. Exclusions: under 16 yrs; co-existing STIs, extra-genital chlamydia. Intervention: eligible people were sent an SMS message with a link to access results from eSHC via a password protected web-app, optimised for smartphone use. Having consented online chlamydia-positive users followed the automated Chlamydia-OCCP. Patients who declined received routine care. Evaluation: treatment rate; time to treatment; PN outcomes; engagement with clinical helpline and health promotion; safety; acceptability, costs. Results GUM: of 197 eligible patients, 161 accessed results online, 112 consented, 110/112 (98%) treated (72 exclusively via Chlamydia-OCCP, median 1 day). NCSP: of 145 eligible patients, 133 accessed results online, 104 consented, 92/104 (88%) treated (59 exclusively via Chlamydia-OCCP, median 1 day).28/515 sexual partners were managed solely online. 1176/1936, (61%) NCSP chlamydia-negative people accessed results online, of whom 407 accessed online health promotion. All patients who didn’t access results online were managed routinely. Patients moved effectively between online, telephone and clinic-based care. Conclusion Chlamydia-OCCP is a feasible, acceptable, safe alternative to routine care for management of people with genital chlamydia. Preliminary evidence indicates comparable treatment outcomes. If linked to home testing, Chlamydia-OCCP offers potential for wholly remote care.',\n",

TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1)/AUXIN-SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) auxin receptors are F-box subunits of ubiquitin ligase complexes. In response to auxin, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and target them for degradation via ubiquitination. Here we identify adenylate cyclase (AC) activity as an additional function of TIR1/AFB receptors across land plants. Auxin, together with Aux/IAAs, stimulates cAMP production. Three separate mutations in the AC motif of the TIR1 C-terminal region, all of which abolish the AC activity, each render TIR1 ineffective in mediating gravitropism and sustained auxin-induced root growth inhibition, and also affect auxin-induced transcriptional regulation. These results highlight the importance of TIR1/AFB AC activity in canonical auxin signalling. They also identify a unique phytohormone receptor cassette combining F-box and AC motifs, and the role of cAMP as a second messenger in plants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The dynamics of a system defined by an endomorphism is essentially different from that of a system defined by a diffeomorphism due to interaction of invariant objects with the so-called critical locus. A planar endomorphism typically folds the phase space along curves J0 where the Jacobian of the map is singular. The critical locus, denoted J1, is the image of J0. It is often only piecewise smooth due to the presence of isolated cusp points that are persistent under perturbation. We investigate what happens when the stable set Ws of a fixed point or periodic orbit interacts with J1 near such a cusp point C1. Our approach is in the spirit of bifurcation theory, and we classify the different unfoldings of the codimension-two singularity where the curve Ws is tangent to J1 exactly at C1. The analysis uses a local normal-form setup that identifies the possible local phase portraits. These local phase portraits give rise to different global manifestations of the behavior as organized by five different global bifurcation diagrams.',\n",

However, limited options for fertility preservation, coupled with vague policy recommendations, give rise to variations in information-sharing between health care professionals and TYAs, particularly as it involves sensitive discussions regarding the short- and long-term effects of cancer and treatments on fertility and reproduction. This paper presents findings from a wider evaluation at a specialist unit for TYAs with cancer. Forty people participated in semi-structured interviews, including 20 young people, parents and partners. Young people were between 2 months and 4 years from finishing treatment. Most young people received mixed levels of information on fertility and counselling before treatment. Diagnosis in the early teens meant how, and from whom, young people received information varied. Young women tended to receive incomplete information. The majority of young people were unaware of their fertility status after treatment had finished. Findings point to the inherent challenges that exist in ensuring young people aged between 13 and 25 years receive comprehensive information on their fertility and potential risk, as well as advice on how to determine their fertility status after treatment has finished.',\n",

Uniform and hybrid crystalline-amorphous Si nanowire (SiNW) growth is achieved via a vapour-liquid-solid mechanism using a Sn metal catalyst. SiNWs of less than 300 nm diameter are known to be less susceptible to fracture and when grown this way have direct electrical conductivity to the current collector, with sufficient room for expansion. Electrochemical characterisation shows stable cycling at capacities of 1400 mA h g-1 (>4 × the capacity limit of graphite). This hybrid system demonstrates promising electrochemical performance, can be grown at large scale and has also been successfully grown on flexible carbon paper current collectors.

The crystal plastic finite element method coupled with micromechanics constitutive model is applied to study the effect of secondary crystal orientation on plastic deformation and mechanical behavior around the cooling holes and notches with the primary (load) orientation fixed at [001] direction. For nickel-based superalloy plates with holes or notches, the secondary crystal orientation effect on the strength needs to be clarified at various load levels. The maximum von Mises stress in the single-crystal alloy varies significantly with variation in the secondary crystal orientations.

       "  'abstract': 'Background The increasing pervasiveness of mobile technologies has given potential to transform healthcare by facilitating clinical management using software applications. These technologies may provide valuable tools in sexual health care and potentially overcome existing practical and cultural barriers to routine testing for sexually transmitted infections. In order to inform the design of a mobile health application for STIs that supports self-testing and self-management by linking diagnosis with online care pathways, we aimed to identify the dimensions and range of preferences for user interface design features among young people. Methods Nine focus group discussions were conducted (n\\u2009=\\u200949) with two age-stratified samples (16 to 18 and 19 to 24 year olds) of young people from Further Education colleges and Higher Education establishments. Discussions explored young people’s views with regard to: the software interface; the presentation of information; and the ordering of interaction steps. Discussions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Four over-arching themes emerged: privacy and security; credibility; user journey support; and the task-technology-context fit. From these themes, 20 user interface design recommendations for mobile health applications are proposed. For participants, although privacy was a major concern, security was not perceived as a major potential barrier as participants were generally unaware of potential security threats and inherently trusted new technology. Customisation also emerged as a key design preference to increase attractiveness and acceptability. Conclusions Considerable effort should be focused on designing healthcare applications from the patient’s perspective to maximise acceptability. The design recommendations proposed in this paper provide a valuable point of reference for the health design community to inform development of mobile–based health interventions for the diagnosis and treatment of a number of other conditions for this target group, while stimulating conversation across multidisciplinary communities.',\n",

Aim: to determine a consensus regarding the minimum number of undistorted i.e., diagnostic quality pulses required, as well as a threshold proportion of noisy beats for recording rejection. Approach: Questionnaire distributed to international fellow researchers in skin contact PPG measurements on signal quality expectations and associated factors concerning recording length, expected artifact-free pulses (“diagnostic quality”) in a trace, proportion of trace having artifact to justify excluding/repeating measurements, minimum beats required, and number of respiratory cycles. Main Results: 18 (of 26) PPG researchers responded. Modal range estimates considered a 2-min recording time as target for morphological analysis. Respondents expected a recording to have 86–95% of diagnostic quality pulses, at least 11–20 sequential pulses of diagnostic quality and advocated a 26–50% noise threshold for recording rejection. There were broader responses found for the required number of undistorted beats (although a modal range of 51–60 beats for both finger and toe sites was indicated). Significance: For morphological PPG pulse wave analysis recording acceptability was indicated if <50% of beats have artifact and preferably that a minimum of 50 non-distorted PPG pulses are present (with at least 11–20 sequential) to be of diagnostic quality. Estimates from this knowledge transfer exercise should help inform students and researchers as a guide in standards development for PPG study design.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The interactions between the components of many real-world systems are best modelled by networks with multiple layers. Different theories have been proposed to explain how multilayered connections affect the linear stability of synchronization in dynamical systems. However, the resulting equations are computationally expensive, and therefore difficult, if not impossible, to solve for large systems. To bridge this gap, we develop a mean-field theory of synchronization for networks with multiple interaction layers. By assuming quasi-identical layers, we obtain accurate assessments of synchronization stability that are comparable with the exact results. In fact, the accuracy of our theory remains high even for networks with very dissimilar layers, thus posing a general question about the mean-field nature of synchronization stability in multilayer networks. Moreover, the computational complexity of our approach is only quadratic in the number of nodes, thereby allowing the study of systems whose investigation was thus far precluded.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Introduction Components other than the active ingredients of treatment can have substantial effects on pain and disability. Such ‘non-specific’ components include: the therapeutic relationship, the healthcare environment, incidental treatment characteristics, patients’ beliefs and practitioners’ beliefs. This study aims to: identify the most powerful non-specific treatment components for low back pain (LBP), compare their effects on patient outcomes across orthodox (physiotherapy) and complementary (osteopathy, acupuncture) therapies, test which theoretically derived mechanistic pathways explain the effects of non-specific components and identify similarities and differences between the therapies on patient–practitioner interactions.\\n\\nMethods and analysis This research comprises a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study with a nested mixed-methods study. A minimum of 144 practitioners will be recruited from public and private sector settings (48 physiotherapists, 48 osteopaths and 48 acupuncturists). Practitioners are asked to recruit 10–30 patients each, by handing out invitation packs to adult patients presenting with a new episode of LBP. The planned multilevel analysis requires a final sample size of 690 patients to detect correlations between predictors, hypothesised mediators and the primary outcome (self-reported back-related disability on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire). Practitioners and patients complete questionnaires measuring non-specific treatment components, mediators and outcomes at: baseline (time 1: after the first consultation for a new episode of LBP), during treatment (time 2: 2\\u2005weeks post-baseline) and short-term outcome (time 3: 3\\u2005months post-baseline). A randomly selected subsample of participants in the questionnaire study will be invited to take part in a nested mixed-methods study of patient–practitioner interactions. In the nested study, 63 consultations (21/therapy) will be audio-recorded and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively, to identify communication practices associated with patient outcomes.\\n\\nEthics and dissemination The protocol is approved by the host institution's ethics committee and the NHS Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journal articles, conferences and a stakeholder workshop.\\n\\nPublisher Statement: This is an Open Access article distributed in accordance with the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt and build upon this work, for commercial use, provided the original work is properly cited.

Yet they continue to make up the majority of religious adherents. Accounting for this seeming paradox is the focus of this volume. If women undergird the foundations of religion but are leaving in large numbers, why are they leaving? Where are they going? What are they doing? And what's happening to those who remain? Women and Religion in the West addresses a neglected yet crucial issue within the debate on religious belonging and departure: the role of women in and out of religion and spirituality. Beginning with an analysis of the relationship between gender and secularization, the book moves its focus to in-depth examination of women's experiences based on data from key recent qualitative work on women and religion. This volume addresses not only women's place in and out of Christianity (the normal focus of secularization theories) but also alternative spiritualities and Islam, asking how questions of secularization differ between faith systems. This book offers students and scholars of religion, sociology, and women's studies, as well as interested general readers, an accessible work on the religiosity of western women and contributes fresh analyses of the rapidly shifting terrain of contemporary religion and spirituality.\",\n",

Seventeen registered service dog providers were invited to complete a mixed methods online survey. Five providers, who prepared dogs to work with a wide range of conditions and behaviours, mainly Asperger's syndrome, autism and communication disorders, completed the survey. All five participants reported that they expected to see positive changes as a consequence of the service dog placement, in both the recipient child and their family, including improvements in attention span and language skills, as well as increased familial cohesion. Survey responses indicated that not all desired outcomes were routinely assessed. The range of assessments used were interviews, intake conversations, pre-placement questionnaires, child social dairies filled in by parents, follow up surveys after placement, and child observation by parents. No specifically named valid and reliable clinical or research measures were referred to, showing an emphasis on assessments from parents and service dog providers. It is not clear whether pre-intervention assessments are repeated systematically at follow-up, which could show robust intervention effects.

       "  'abstract': 'Background UK rates of early cancer detection are lower than in many other western countries and survival remains relatively poor. At present early (pre-symptomatic) cancer detection is limited to cases identified through specific national screening programmes or via incidental radiological findings. In 2012, fifteen UK universities established an Early Cancer Detection (ECD) Consortium to identify, validate and implement new generic blood tests for early tumour detection. Although the introduction of regular Early Cancer Detection blood tests should improve early detection across all cancer types, it will also extend significantly the population of patients who are identified as at risk and their support needs. For patients waiting to receive a final diagnosis of cancer type/stage it will be a stressful experience, as will ongoing surveillance. Method The importance of psychological support is already recognised for people living with cancer. Studies to date indicate that information and support offered has the potential to influence wellbeing, future health behaviour (e.g. screening uptake), and coping with a final diagnosis. Building on a self-management programme developed for survivors of cancer (HOPE), a peer-support programme for ECD patients is being developed (eCOPE). This incorporates online collection of outcomes and health/social care resource use data, enabling impact on patient wellbeing and costs to be recorded during the early diagnostic and monitoring phases. eCOPE development is based on structured psychological approaches, combined with co-creation, and co-delivery (e.g. peer and professional). Results This presentation will outline the first stages in bringing together the underpinning evidence to support the development of an online peer-support programme for Early Cancer Detection patients. Conclusion For large-scale Early Cancer Detection testing any support offered to patients will need to be cost-effective. The development of this novel online peer-support programme offers the potential for a cost effective approach in patient support and self management within an Early Cancer Detection programme.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is an important tool for working with polynomial systems, particularly quantifier elimination. However, it has complexity doubly exponential in the number of variables. The base algorithm can be improved by adapting to take advantage of any equational constraints (ECs): equations logically implied by the input. Intuitively, we expect the double exponent in the complexity to decrease by one for each EC. In ISSAC 2015 the present authors proved this for the factor in the complexity bound dependent on the number of polynomials in the input. However, the other term, that dependent on the degree of the input polynomials, remained unchanged. In the present paper the authors investigate how CAD in the presence of ECs could be further refined using the technology of Gr¨obner Bases to move towards the intuitive bound for polynomial degree.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper describes the development of a detailed finite element (FE) model of an aircraft test tyre in order to investigate its performance and assess its safety criteria. It is noticed that rubber and fabric composite materials are the major components of this tyre model and their characterization requires tests and correlation. The characterization of such materials is of great importance in the model development process.\\n\\nDue to its complicated mechanical behaviour that exceeds the linear elastic theory, rubber is generally considered as hyperelastic material in FE analysis. It can be defined by a stored energy function with various coefficients that need to be determined by a series of experimental test data. The key issue is to define an appropriate energy function that can provide good fit with the experimental test data.\\n\\nInitially, a full-scaled LS-Dyna FE model has been development to replicate the actual geometry of the target test tyre. The material properties of each individual component have been characterized and correlated with industrial uniaxial tension test data. The inflation and static load simulations have been analyzed basing on the characterized tyre model, indicating its reliability.\\n\\nThe dynamic simulations that aim to duplicate tyre load upon aircraft landing scenarios have also been analyzed. Following the comments and guidelines from aircraft industrial data, the dynamic simulations have covered the tyre loading scenarios from normal (soft) landing, hard landing to crash landing under different aircraft landing weights and vertical speeds. The tyre deflection rate and the contact load have been chosen as the safety criteria. The simulation analysis, results and comments have been discussed in detail.\\n\\nThe modelling and correlation processes described in this paper aim to demonstrate the importance of hyperelastic material characterization in developing a detailed FE tyre model. Such a predictive model can be effectively used during tyre design process to allow manufacturers to assess its availability, and also add to the general drive towards the use of more virtual prototypes in an area traditionally reliant on experimental testing.',\n",

However, it is unclear how it varies across the full age spectrum from child to senior and for different peripheral measurement sites. The objectives of this study were to determine the association between age and pulse risetime characteristics over an 8-decade age range at the ears, fingers, and toes, and to consider effects arising from differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP), height and heart rate. APPROACH: Multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG) pulse waveforms were recorded non-invasively from the right and left ears, fingers, and toes of 304 normal healthy human subjects (range 6-87 years; 156 male and 148 female). SBP, height, and heart rate were also measured. Multi-site PPG pulse risetimes, and their site differences, were determined. MAIN RESULTS: Univariate regression analysis showed positive correlations with risetime for age (ears, fingers and toes: + 0.8, + 1.9, and + 1.1 ms/year, respectively), SBP (+0.5, + 1.3, and + 0.9 ms/mmHg) and height (+0.5, + 1.2, and + 1.0 ms/cm), but with a clear inverse association with heart rate (-1.8, - 2.5, and - 1.6 ms min) (P < 0.0001). No significant differences between male and female subjects were found for pulse risetime. SIGNIFICANCE: Normative multi-site PPG risetime characteristics have been defined in over 300 subjects and are shown to increase with age linearly up to the 8th decade. In contrast, we have shown that heart rate has a clear inverse relationship with risetime for all measurement sites.',\n",

Consultant-lead multidisciplinary team supported practice staffs from the eight intervention practices manage patients not achieving diabetes treatment targets. Virtual patient data sharing using the Eclipse® diabetes data manager allowed case finding, advice and monitoring. A major focus was also on promoting staff and patient education. The other eight control practices provided usual care. Practice level, aggregate data for outcomes were analysed. Primary outcome was improvement in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC) after one year.\\nResults\\nThe intervention practices (n=2739) achieved improvement in HbA1c and BP while the control practices (n=2268) noticed some progress in HbA1c and TC targets. Compared to control, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for intervention practices with proportions of patients with Diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg (0.67 [0.44, 1.02], p=0.063), Systolic BP ≥150 mmHg (0.88 [0.61, 1.27], p=0.481), HbA1c ≥85 mmol/mol (0.92 [0.75, 1.13], p=0.434), HbA1c ≥75 mmol/mol (0.94 [0.80, 1.11], p=0.477) and HbA1c ≥59 (0.99 [0.86, 1.14], p=0.929;) were lower whilst such OR were higher for TC:HDLC ratio ≥5 (1.16 [0.95, 1.41], p=0.134) and TC ≥5 mmol/L (1.17 [1.01, 1.37], p=0.041).\\nConclusion\\nTargeted support from consultant-led team led to encouraging albeit statistically insignificant improvement in BP and glycaemic control than usual care.

Composite insulated sandwich panels were fabricated using woven E/glass fiber plies and metal sheet as face skins stacked to the core. Quasi-static flexural three-point bending and indentation tests were carried out to investigate the mechanical responses of the manufactured sandwich panels. Stress distribution and crack growth of the reinforced beam elements in flexural tests were captured and tracked through a digital image correlation method. The effects of several parameters such as the indenter’s diameter, nose shape geometry and face sheet stacking sequence on the energy absorption behavior of specimens with different boundary conditions based on visual observation of captured microscopic images were explored and compared. Test results indicated that both indenter diameter and boundary conditions affect response and damage mechanisms significantly whereas indenter nose shape has a slight effect on energy absorption. The results illustrate the benefit of incorporation of fiber metal laminate face sheets as a simple and cost-effective in situ technique to strengthening the existing lightweight cementitious materials used in the construction of non-structural components.',\n",

We found that MALE-ASSOCIATED ARGONAUTE-1 and -2 associate with temperature-induced phased secondary small RNAs in pre-meiotic anthers and are essential to controlling the activity of retrotransposons in male meiocyte initials. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed how male-associated Argonaute activity and its interaction with retrotransposon RNA targets is modulated through the dynamic phosphorylation of a set of highly conserved, surface-located serine residues. Our results demonstrate that an Argonaute-dependent, RNA-guided surveillance mechanism is critical in plants to sustain male fertility under environmentally constrained conditions, by controlling the mutagenic activity of transposons in male germ cells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"When using cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) to solve a problem with respect to a set of polynomials, it is likely not the signs of those polynomials that are of paramount importance but rather the truth values of certain quantifier free formulae involving them. This observation motivates our article and definition of a Truth Table Invariant CAD (TTICAD). In ISSAC 2013 the current authors presented an algorithm that can efficiently and directly construct a TTICAD for a list of formulae in which each has an equational constraint. This was achieved by generalising McCallum's theory of reduced projection operators. In this paper we present an extended version of our theory which can be applied to an arbitrary list of formulae, achieving savings if at least one has an equational constraint. We also explain how the theory of reduced projection operators can allow for further improvements to the lifting phase of CAD algorithms, even in the context of a single equational constraint. The algorithm is implemented fully in Maple and we present both promising results from experimentation and a complexity analysis showing the benefits of our contributions.\",\n",

In the English NHS Breast Screening Programme each woman’s mammograms are examined separately by two expert readers. The two readers read each batch in the same order and each indicates if there should be recall for further tests. This is a highly skilled, pressurised, repetitive and frequently intellectually unchallenging activity where readers examine one or more batches of 30–50 women’s mammograms in each session. A vigilance decrement or performance decrease over time has been observed in similar repetitive visual tasks such as radar operation. Methods/Design The CO-OPS study is a pragmatic, multi-centre, two-arm, double blind cluster randomised controlled trial of a computer software intervention designed to reduce the effects of a vigilance decrement in breast cancer screening. The unit of randomisation is the batch. Intervention batches will be examined in the opposite order by the two readers (one forwards, one backwards). Control batches will be read in the same order as one another, as is current standard practice. The hypothesis is that cancer detection rates will be higher in the intervention group because each readers’ peak performance will occur when examining different women’s mammograms. The trial will take place in 44 English breast screening centres for 1 year and 4 months. The primary outcome is cancer detection rate, which will be extracted from computer records after 1 year of the trial. The secondary outcomes include rate of disagreement between readers (a more statistically powerful surrogate for cancer detection rate), recall rate, positive predictive value, and interval cancer rate (cancers found between screening rounds which will be measured three years after the end of the trial).

Rosiglitazone has shown to reduce IR,but it was recently withdrawn from the market due to severe side-effects. Basic research into developing optimised drug treatments for IR in PCOS is critical to reducing the development of PCOS associated diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Testing and optimising drugs to reduce IR in PCOS patient samples is difficult due to ethical restrictions. In vitro organ culture models are valuable and reliable. Coronary arteries incubated with high doses of insulin and glucose will be screened for reliable intracellular IR associated biomarkers by western blot and real time PCR analysis. Vascular function by wire-myograph analysis will validate endothelial dysfunction and assess myocardial vascular injury associated responses. The associated response to clinically relevant anti-diabetic treatment options and adjunct therapy will be investigated. Developing a PCOS IR simulated organ culture model will enable us to understand the complicated intracellular signalling mechanisms leading to IR and may lead to development of potential new drug therapy options improving the PCOS IR treatment outcome.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This article explores understandings and practices of marriage in a congregation from the growing British evangelical Christian movement New Frontiers International (NFI). It investigates how those who subscribe to evangelical religion interact with the gendered ideas and behaviour of the more ‘secular’ society they inhabit. The data for this research are drawn from participant observation and interviews with members of the congregation. These are situated in the context of the official discourse of NFI and of contemporary debates about the move to individualized partnership. It is argued that though these evangelicals claim to shape their marriages according to ‘biblical’ patterns, they in fact reflect the partnership practices of their less religious peers. Building on work by Stacey and McRobbie, patterns of marriage and heterosexual partnership in contemporary Britain are conceptualized as ‘postfeminist’; the article locates within this framework NFI's declared – and undeclared – marriage practices. It finds that while they are somewhat more conservative than their ‘secular’ peers, NFI evangelicals are indeed practising postfeminist partnership. Observations are also offered on the impact of religion on people's ability to live out individualized partnerships.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tyres have an important role in landing gear systems upon aircraft landing and taxing on the ground. The performances of an aircraft tyre under varied load conditions are vital requirements for aircraft safety certification. This paper describes the development of a detailed finite element (FE) model of an aircraft test tyre in order to investigate its performance and assess its safety criteria. The work follows the findings from previous researches and focuses on the aircraft tyre safety assessment under various loading scenarios that were not yet studied. Initially, tyre inflation and static load simulations have been analyzed based on a full-scaled 3D detail LS-Dyna® FE model, replicating the actual geometry and the correlated material properties from industrial experimental data. The dynamic simulations that aim to duplicate tyre load upon aircraft landing scenarios have also been analyzed. Following the comments from aircraft tyre industrial data and guidelines[5] [6], the dynamic simulations have covered the tyre loading scenario from on-road taxing, normal (soft) landing, hard landing to crash landing under different aircraft landing weights. The stresses on tyre/wheel contact areas and on bead cords have been chosen as the safety criteria. The simulation results, analysis and comments have been discussed in great details. The modelling and simulations described in this paper aim to demonstrate the effective use of FE models for aircraft safety assessment, by studying the criteria of the tyre for load cases corresponding with testing and operational scenarios. The development of such predictive model would allow the manufacturers to assess tyre availability during the design process, and also add to the general drive towards the use of more virtual prototypes in an area traditionally reliant on experimental testing.',\n",
